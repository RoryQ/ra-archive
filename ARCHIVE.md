### keiyaA – hooke's law (XL Recordings)
> Bad blood. Depression. Snide landlords. And then there's all the fun in between. Written during a time of deep self-reflection, hooke's law follows keiyaA as she tears everything and everyone up only to emerge more invigorated than ever. Following her beloved debut album, these 19 tracks are a remarkable crossover between R&B, ambient and the kind of experimental music you might expect from genre-adverse producers like Klein and DJ Haram. Soulful and sexy, scornful and weird, the album charts an explosive period of emotional growth.

### DJ SWISHA – FIRST HAND SMOKE (Self-Released)
> On his debut album, New York club king DJ SWISHA samples house, R&B and pop, folding his encyclopedic music knowledge into a pointedly North American package. Here, Baltimore club meets Jersey club, and footwork and juke beats rearrange the soulful molecules of R&B. There's nothing quite as earth shattering as "CLUB MEGAMIXXX" (RA's best track of 2023), but these are dance floor tools refined for the album format, meaning there's plenty of living-room listenability.

### DJ Babatr – Root Echoes (Hakuna Kalula)
> Carefully selected from more than 700 archived works made between 2003 and 2007, Root Echoes documents raptor house at its subversive peak. With each sweaty, speeding track, DJ Babatr redefines the genre with a watertight mission: amplifying Afro-Venezuelan voices.

### Various – Techno Kayō Vol. 1 - Japanese Techno Pop 1981 - 1989 (Compiled by Dubby & Antal) (Rush Hour)
> Dubby, one of the curators of Japanese Techno Pop 1981 - 1989, recently told Magazine Sixty that techno pop has a "rather cheesy and slightly tacky image" in Japan. This compilation aims to correct that narrative—and how. Focusing on the genre's niche and experimental branches, it takes listeners from the cosmic funk of TPO and Linda's "Rock The Hour" to the leftfield sound collage of Kazuo Ohtani's "Last Battle."

### Blawan – SickElixir (XL Recordings)
> These 14 brutal tracks judder from industrial hip-hop to syncopated sludge, redefining what a techno LP can be. But what really gives this record its otherworldly feel is Blawan's voice. Twisted into a monstrous rasp through layers of filters, it's the first thing we hear and it holds everything together from there on out.

### Carrier – Rhythm Immortal (Modern Love)
> As a producer, Carrier specialises in white space. On Rhythm Immortal, the UK artist's use of percussion is the centrepiece, but the gaps he leaves in between the beats are the most compelling. Dub techno, ambient, industrial and jazz motifs unite in perfect harmony. Just listen to "Offshore," where slithering synths and hiccuping drums are tempered by saxophone and piano chords that gleam quietly like little spots of sun.

### Various – Rhythm 2 Revolt Solidarity Compilation (Hood Rave)
> BAE BAE's Hood Rave party is one of Los Angeles' best. Why? Because of its outspoken commitment to liberation. The platform's first compilation splits proceeds between the Gaza Mutual Aid Solidarity Fund and NDLON's Immigrant Defense Fund, featuring songs that skitter between ambient, techno and East Coast club. Daniel Pineda's "Do Something" captures the sense of urgency underlining both politics and dance floors right now. Note the blaring siren, club breaks and a voice echoing, "Do something to stop the killing."

### Felicity J Lord – FJL (STROOM.TV)
> Although technically released in late September, this album is catnip for fans of Voice Actor, Klein and Dean Blunt. A 26-track LP might seem like overkill these days, but FJL's vignettes are made for the ADD generation. These short songs loop familiar pop and R&B samples—cozy and familiar playgrounds from which emerge the most chaotic spoken word you'll hear on a record this year.

### Charmaine Lee – Tulpa (Kou Records)
> This is the kind of record that will deeply satisfy experimental music enthusiasts who wait patiently every year for cutting-edge festivals like Unsound and Dripping. The New York artist's dark ambient soundscapes blanket intense, complex vocal processing that turns quick breaths, hums and tongue clicks into shuddering rhythms.

### CRRDR – LATINCORE LEGEND (LATINCORE)
> Bogotá's CRRDR doesn't take his title of "Latincore legend" lightly. The genre he champions takes the speeding BPMs and blistering intensity of hardstyle, blending it with guaracha, reggaeton and dembow. Throughout his debut album, bachata meets Jersey club ("Te Gusta Mi Bachata"), Eurodance fuses with guaracha ("Oh Baby") and IDM synths glimmer over a reggaeton beat. Tapping vocalists from Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and Chile, this a sublime representation of the Latincore movement.

### Dania – Listless (Somewhere Press)
> Smoky drums, slushy guitar and a delicate voice that whispers through the darkness. Comprising seven tracks written after midnight, Dania's Listless takes the mystery of the witching hour and infuses it into this superb journey through shadow-filled trip-hop and fantastical ambient.

### Jasmín – Bite The Hand That Feeds You (Hessle Audio)
> On her first fully fledged record—and Hessle Audio's 50th release—Jasmín continues to explore the label's techno-dubstep roots. This is a wicked batch of searing techno that snakes between Latin American rhythms, industrial and the deep blare of dubstep.

### Beatrice M. – Midnight Swim (Tectonic Recordings)
> Another hit from an artist who can't stop making them. Rippling from dubstep to dub techno, Beatrice M. creates tracks with the quiet dynamism and depth of an ocean. It's so detailed that it's less of a soundscape than an entire new world of slippery bass and minuscule sounds, urging you to climb inside.

### Qemist – The New Juke Tape (Moveltraxx)
> Juke and footwork were born in Chicago but they maintain a strong grip beyond the Midwest. Based out of Memphis, Tennessee, Qemist takes these genres and puts them into a blender, resulting in a high-BPM fusion of unwieldy, banging East Coast club, jungle and R&B.

### Full Circle – Beyond Knowhere (Good Morning Tapes)
> Following a corrective Goa trance compilation aiming to give the Indian-born psychedelic dance sound its flowers, Parisian duo Full Circle continue their focus on the misunderstood genre on Beyond Knowhere. This is progressive house indebted to the psychedelia of Goa trance, featuring plenty of reverbed sitar and detailed acid. "Painting Noise" even has a trip-hop chug.

### De Grandi – Testa Dura (Tratratrax)
> This full-throttle EP takes cues from dubstep, techno and club music, looping twisty, squelchy basslines and heaving drums to explosive effect. The record flies out the traps: the opening title track plows through a monstrous bassline and quick-fire drums. The remixes do the blistering tunes justice, with Call Super and Parris bringing a quirky, drum-forward house touch on their "Yeah But Still" version.

### Wata Igarashi, Polygonia – Cross Passage (Reclaim Your City)
> Polygonia and Wata Igarashi approach hypnotic ecstasy from different angles: the former goes for blissed-out baubles; the latter embraces the growl of blazing arpeggios. On their latest collaborative EP, you can hear Polygonia's melodic brightness, while the grimey deepness sounds like the handiwork of Igarashi. Cross Passage is a gold mine for psychedelic techno enthusiasts.

### NTS - 100% D'Angelo 
> Few artists have reshaped modern soul as profoundly as D'Angelo. Following his death in October, Shy One offers a heartfelt tribute tracing the arc of his genius, from the church-rooted warmth of Brown Sugar to the fractured funk of Black Messiah. Moving through hits, deep cuts and collaborations, this two-hour mix celebrates an artist who was forever chasing the divine through groove, analogue grit and a one-of-a-kind lyricism.

### Closing Set at Sustain-Release 2025 
> As autumn settles across the northern hemisphere, a wave of festival recordings return to remind us of summer's glow. Among the standouts from this year's romp in Camp Kennybrook is a luminous two-hour journey from Mia Koden, RA's Breaking Through artist of 2024. Rooted in a deep love of Black diasporic music, she moves from dubstep to hip-hop, drifting from Commodo and Daweh Congo to Bahamadia and Minnie Riperton. According to one RA staffer on the dance floor, there were "tears everywhere" and a voice periodically yelling, "What the fuck, Mia?!"

### Sugar Free at Selectors - Dekmantel 2025 
> A Sugar Free set lands differently. There's a sleazy allure to her take on techno, house and breakbeat, and her vinyl-only sets honour the tradition of the format while always sounding strikingly fresh. The Madrid-based DJ has a knack for uncanny blends: hypnotic grooves meet elastic basslines and trippy, late-night textures weave between deep techno, minimal and psychedelic trance. For her Dekmantel debut, she delivered what she does best: deep, headsy, timeless dance music.

### NTS 
> Nine years since his last NTS Radio appearance, Henry Rollins returns with his trademark intensity intact. The LA icon—who has donned the role of band frontman, actor, essayist and more throughout his polymathic career—spends two hours digging through punk, hardcore and new wave treasures. It's an essential look into Rollin's unique, far-reaching collection.

### Live At Dripping 
> Seattle's Succubass is a pillar of the US DIY underground, and for their Friday night set at Dripping, they turned The Barn into a fever dream of bass and distortion. Moving from Zvvra's tactile techno and the dub of Gil.Barte to the heady steppers of Commodo & Gantz, Succubass stitches together something raw, cinematic and deeply physical. Each drop makes it feel like the music was testing the limits of the small room.

### MNMT 488 
> Listen to any set from Kia, Priori or Cousin and you'll likely hear the dubbed out productions of Mexican-Jamaican producer Andy Martin. Based in Guadalajara, he has become a quiet force in the global underground, uniting sci-fi techno with the rhythmic sensibilities of the Caribbean and Latin America. For Norway's Monument Festival, he delivers a transportive set that moves from the weightless dub pressure of Bukkha and Abstract Man into sleek, hypnotic techno from Oscar Mulero and Unbalance. Here's an hour of music laced with deep bass, subtle psychedelia and shimmering percussive detail.

### IT.podcast.s14e07 
> Scott Zacharias has long been one of Detroit's best-kept secrets. His singular, offbeat taste has made his No Way Back sets the stuff of legend. This year's closing in the Outer Space Room was among his most personal yet—as Zacharias recounts in the description, his partner joined him on-stage at the end of the set to celebrate her pregnancy. Anchored by the spirit of Arthur Russell's "In The Light Of The Miracle," the set drifts through everything from cosmic dub and art-pop melancholia to ambient techno and ecstatic house over the course of five hours.

### Making Time 2025 
> As cofounder of experimental label SLINK, K Wata has become one of New York's most exciting new producers, known for slinky micro-dubs and bass music that messes with perception. His set from this year's Making Time ∞ follows that same thread: psychedelic, dubstep-adjacent and full of pressure, threading tracks from Deadbeat, Wata Igarashi and Paleman into something that feels somehow both heavy and weightless. It's club music that breathes, flexes and rearranges the air around you.

### Malibu – Vanities (YEAR0001)
> French electronic artist Malibu is known for her transcendental performances. When paired with white beams of light that circle her audience, her wordless live sets become deeply surreal. Vanities, her filmic debut album, aims to transport you to that otherworldly state. While it draws from the soothing chords and glittery instrumentation of New Age and baroque music, the silvery pop melodies steal the show. This is weighty, elegant ambient that should be listened to with a proper sub, so that its immersive waves of sound envelop you.

### Paul St. Hilaire – Paul St. Hilaire - w/ The Producers (Kynant Records)
> Paul St. Hilaire (AKA Tikiman) has contributed his sweet, sinuous vocals to dub techno records since his early work with Basic Channel. His latest album is a treat to longtime fans, featuring a host of top-drawer producers. Shinichi Atobe's lurid house bubbles under Hilaire's reverbed vocals; Priori's zippy tech house meets his heavily distorted asides. This is collaborative experimentation at its finest.

### Acopia – Blush Response (Scenic Route)
> Rich with shoegazey guitars, simmering electronica and frontwoman Kate Durman's most plaintive vocals to date, Blush Response luxuriates in rock elements that lingered in the margins of previous Acopia albums. The rawness of the instrumentation, peppered with tiny textural details, distinguishes this LP from the group's signature dream pop. By unpixelating their previous sound, Acopia reach the perfect balance between gut-wrenching drama and understated surrender.

### james K – Friend (AD 93)
> On her hotly anticipated new LP, Friend, james K sets herself loose inside a carefully constructed assemblage of drum & bass, trip-hop and shoegaze, carving offbeat shapes from the contemporary resurgence of all three genres. The album is crisper, cleaner and more complex than any of her back catalogue, drawing from crystalline pop and rock while maintaining her characteristic enigma. Full of lush, expansive pads and skittering microbeats, these songs sound like half-remembered dreams.

### Sammy Virji – Same Day Cleaning (Polydor)
> If you like Sammy Virji's radio-friendly, vocal-heavy UKG, you're going to love Same Day Cleaning. There's a real musicality to the album, which spans garage house, speed garage and more, with the warmth of acoustic instruments occasionally squeezed in. In tandem with some of the UK's most in-demand MCs and vocalists—Flowdan, Skepta, Issey Cross—Virji totally steps up, showcasing songwriting agility that explains the current hype and glut of sold-out shows.

### Joanne Robertson – Blurrr (AD 93)
> Joanne Robertson is widely known for her vocal cameos on records by Dean Blunt and Elias Rønnenfelt. But her latest solo album, Blurrr, establishes her as an artist in her own right. Written in between painting sessions and caring for her toddler, the gorgeous LP features drumless guitar ballads alongside contributions from cellist Oliver Coates. Most arresting, though, are the moods she conveys. Achieving a compositional yin-yang, she somehow scores both the euphoria of depression and the grief of joy.

### Kelman Duran – Scorpio Falling (Scorpio Red)
> Dembow experimentalist Kelman Duran makes shadowy music that conjures scenes of sodden tunnel paths at nightfall. Beneath his shrouded pads are distinctly Caribbean sounds, like dancehall and reggaeton. Scorpio Falling, his first album since 2021's Night In Tijuana, is a gritty journey through jazz, Memphis rap and dark ambient with spurts of spritely dembow breaking the meditative lull.

### Titanic – HAGEN (TAR / MM / UOH)
> Titanic, the avant-garde project from producer and guitarist I. la Católica and cellist Mabe Fratti, returns with punkish elegance on HAGEN. The chords are brighter, Fratti's vocals more dynamic and the ascendent alternative pop swells to new heights. The instrumentation is raw and brash, and Fratti fits right into the mould, her voice bearing visceral emotions with fascinating lightness.

### Lucrecia Dalt – A Danger To Ourselves (RVNG Intl.)
> The past few years have been intense for Lucrecia Dalt. The Colombian artist has experienced several seizures and an eight-second stop to her heart since her last album, ¡Ay!. She also fell head over heels in love. Her latest alt-pop album, A Danger To Ourselves, is full-on haunting, as she whispers through a hall of tip-toeing cello and guitar plucks. Tracks like "stelliformia" carry the immersive lyricism that you'll want to listen to alone in your room. A Danger To Ourselves bristles with the kind of eerie love poems that only Dalt could write.

### YS – Burn (ERF)
> Breezing through laidback trip-hop, luminescent IDM and mellow vocal samples, Burn captures the understated cool that characterised trip-hop's golden era. On "Moth," Janet Jackson exhales through delightfully broken drums. "End" skews slightly darker, featuring a pitched-down vocal announcing that "the end of the world is coming" over sparkling beats. Wherever you end up on this masterpiece, you'll find a goldmine of sophisticated textures.

### LÉO LA NUIT – LE DON DES LARMES (Knekelhuis)
> On LE DON DES LARMES, Franco-Algerian vocalist LÉO LA NUIT is accompanied by guitar, cello and the swirl of her own harmonised vocals. Written for her newborn child, these lilting folk lullabies are inspired by her Kabyle upbringing surrounded by Algerian chaabi. This is a strikingly beautiful portrait of her wispy vocals, which don't need much enhancement to make you feel like you've fallen into a world in which everything has suddenly and blissfully slowed down.

### Skepta, Fred again.. – Skepta .. Fred (Epic Records)
> Although Skepta still hasn't released his long-awaited album Knife and Fork, he's put out a flurry of extremely good singles and even stepped in to replace Deftones at Glastonbury with a much talked-about performance. For his next trick, he gives Fred again.., the super-producer of mixed reputation, some underground cred. The tracks are a welcome, sub-blowing display of 140 BPM club music, making even Fred again..'s most dedicated critics struggle to deny their fun.

### Maara – Revenge from the Penthouse EP (Ancient Records)
> Maara is an exceptionally versatile producer. Her debut album, The Ancient Truth, reveled in slow, chuggy trip-hop, followed by a motley of cheeky, sapphic singles like "Mind The WAP" and, more recently, "I Wanna Scissor Ft. My Hot Ex." But really, her specialty is in building hypnotic, multi-textural worlds. Revenge from the Penthouse does this by barrelling through shades of progressive house, trance and breakbeats, keeping us completely locked across all five tracks.

### TYGAPAW – IMMIGRANT (Tresor)
> The connection that Jamaican artist TYGAPAW has to their queerness and home country is written all across their raucous, politically charged techno. On their new EP, IMMIGRANT, they portray the immigrant experience in post-Trump America as oppressive and repetitive. "Black Trans Masculine Experience" gives the floor to Kings-Lee Rose, who discusses the societal isolation of Black trans masculine people before a flood of percussion fills the soundscape. In TYGAPAW's hands, deep feelings are meant to be released through the hips—you'll hear Jersey club, dancehall and techno rhythms skitter across "M32."

### JSPORT – No Turning Back (JSPORT WORLD)
> From the moment you step off the ledge of its misty opener, No Turning Back situates you in banger after banger. The club rhythms are fierce and unrelenting, speeding through Jersey club beats, dancehall and red-hot R&B samples, all with the iciness of grime. The liner notes couldn't have said it better: "These aren't tracks you play—they're tracks that play you."

### Sam Goku – Explorations 02 (Permanent Vacation)
> Explorations 02 is a frolic through dub techno, fuzzy breakbeats and psychedelic deep house. The rhythms are effervescent and the drums occasionally go hard. But the one trait that stays consistent throughout is the record's glistening aura, made possible by birdsong, muted pads and chiming melodies. This EP is as close to nature as the dance floor.

### NEW YORK – Push (nypop)
> Push sounds eerily familiar. In many ways, it's reminiscent of the late '00s, a time when artists like Chairlift, MGMT and Owl City ruled the radio with glitchy beats that seemed to blast euphoria into listeners' veins. NEW YORK builds on this template with a punkish haze, whispering into the mic as bleeps burst around them.

### Croft – Sanctuary / Shifty (Hang Tough)
> On this two-track EP, Nottingham's Croft offers twisted, hypnotic tech house. Metallic dings penetrate the busy soundscape, as plasticky noises contort across shuffling broken beats. These are the kinds of trippy curveballs that force crowds to stick around.

### Jessy Lanza – "Slapped By My Life" (Hyperdub)
> Jessy Lanza wrote "Slapped By My Life" while her husband was undergoing cancer treatment and she longed to escape into an emotion that felt miles away from her everyday sadness. This track is pure optimism, carried by a sweet hook ("I miss you when you go") and colourful beats flying by at 158 BPM. It's one for the lovers.

### Kia b2b Bitter Babe - Climate of Fear 
> On paper, Kia b2b Bitter Babe shouldn't really work. The former loves supple shades of dub, IDM and techno, while the latter leans towards hazy, sensual and high-energy tunes. But this recording from Berlin party Climate of Fear proves otherwise. Across two hours of molten techno, trance and pan-Latin dance music, the duo showcase their command of complex rhythms—and why they're two of the best in the game right now.

### Gavsborg - Kiosk Radio 
> Jamaican dance music producers don't get the same recognition as their peers in Detroit, Chicago or Berlin. Hailing from East Kingston, Gavsborg carries the torch for this generation. The Berlin-based Equiknoxx founder has spent more than a decade reshaping dancehall with a leftfield sensibility—first breaking through with Busy Signal's charting single, "Step Out," before collaborating with everyone from reggae dub prince Addis Pablo to hip-hop icon Missy Elliott. On Brussels' Kiosk Radio, Gavsborg dropped a scorching mix of dancehall, jungle, zouk and dub, laced with the playful surrealism that defines his productions.

### EMA - subglow/Live 6 per:sona 
> There's a new generation of dubstep kids in town pushing the sound forward in thrilling directions. EMA, founder of the dub-focused Woozy label, is a key force in the movement alongside the likes of Beatrice M. and Mia Koden. For CCL's subglow series, she shared a recording from her kaleidoscopic set at French festival per:sona. Much like her wider work, it's adventurous and unpretentious, with two hours of tightly wound techno, modern steppers and snarling drum & bass grounded in spooky bassweight.

### Short Span - Theory Therapy 82 
> Across its eight-year run, Blowing Up The Workshop tested the limits of the online mix format, giving artists space to experiment and shaping a generation of adventurous listeners along the way. That same curatorial spirit runs through this new Theory Therapy session, which sees BUTW founder Matthew Kent digging into forgotten '00s CDs to piece together a loose set of dubbed-out ambient and downtempo house, with plenty of clicky percussion reminiscent of minimal's dominant era.

### Keanu Nelson - NTS Radio (13th September 2025) 
> Broadcasting from Papunya, one of Australia's most isolated communities, Luritja artist Keanu Nelson offers a rare window into the music and voices of the Northwestern territory. For his latest NTS Radio show, he drifts from ancestral chants and spectral atmospheres to desert rock and jazzy synth pop. The mix moves gracefully between the celebratory and the contemplative, its remarkable range making for a perfect morning listen.

### Maito & Kuba'97 - Live at Klub Dramatik Festival 
> Klub Dramatik is part of a new wave of Belgian parties putting the country's scene on the map. The first entry in its live series comes from two locals at the heart of the action: Maito and Kuba'97. Over three hours, they weave understated house, techno and psychedelia with the patience and flow that comes from years spent on the dance floor, beautifully capturing the exploratory spirit that has Belgium abuzz right now.

### Spurge - Nowadays Nonstop: 06-21-25 
> For his Nowadays debut during Juneteenth weekend, New York DJ and musician Spurge paid homage to his definition of Black sonic excellence. Featuring a range of mostly Black artists—K-HAND, Bad Brains, Princess Peggie, DJ Spanish Fly—it's a danceable, thought-provoking showcase of Black artistry across noise, ambient techno and peak-time club.

### Camille Mandoki - Series 029 
> Mexico City vocalist Camille Mandoki—who features on Lucrecia Dalt's new album—makes powerful sound art. Her gauzy compositions and choral voice carry serious emotional weight, shaking listeners to their core. Her contribution to local mix series Lapi + Filia is just as poignant, featuring delicate jazz, ambient and folk that evoke introspection and fulfillment.

### DJ K – Radio Libertadora ! (Nyege Nyege Tapes)
> Radio Libertadora ! takes bruxaria, a maniacal strain of Brazilian baile funk, and imbues it with the sound of political discordance. Deteriorating synth lines buzz like digital waste and sirens bleat endlessly towards societal collapse. The album plays with genres such as techno, house and '00s hip-hop to bring its messages home. Like the directors of the most exhilarating action films, DJ K specialises in organised chaos. Resilience has rarely sounded so electrifying.

### Blood Orange – Essex Honey (RCA)
> More than being an excellent producer, Dev Hynes, AKA Blood Orange, is a master of various styles. He's produced experimental R&B with Solange, composed for films and worked with the London Symphony Orchestra. His first album in six years brings his experimental edge to the fore, with a hefty features list including Mabe Fratti, Caroline Polachek and Tirzah. These are gorgeously gentle and stripped-back guitar- and piano-led pieces.

### Valesuchi – Futuro Cercano (Discos Nutabe)
> On Futuro Cercano, Valesuchi's newfound love of higher BPMs is on full display, featuring not just techno and electro but also dubstep ("L.O.S."). Just about every synthline is in a minor key and evokes the imagery of a Halloween house of mirrors. Still, there are plenty of beautiful moments of elation. Just wait for when trance chords turn "Regreso" into a sunset anthem.

### Nourished By Time – The Passionate Ones (XL Recordings)
> Nourished By Time's second album, The Passionate Ones, ponders love, loneliness and late-stage capitalism over an impeccable blend of electro funk and breezy indie pop. Its soulful sound, driven by cruising guitars and euphoric synths, buffs up his candid lyrics, making his verses (which channel the extreme honesty of 2013-era Tyler, the Creator) all the more relatable. This is music for when you're down and out, and you just need a good tune to get you through the day.

### Amaarae – Black Star (Interscope Records)
> Featuring cameos from Black luminaries like PinkPantheress, Naomi Campbell and Bree Runway, Black Star embraces the Black electronic music that formed Amaarae's youth. These sounds wafted from the streets to her ears in Accra at the age of six, then at eight in Atlanta, then New Jersey when she was 11. At its best, Black Star shows an artist amplifying Afrodiasporic club traditions with modern verve, unlocking a new wave of Black pop stardom along the way.

### Kaytranada – AIN'T NO DAMN WAY! (RCA)
> Kaytranada's surprise new album, AIN'T NO DAMN WAY!, is the star's finest since 99.9%. It bottles the nonchalant sex appeal and restrained production of his 2016 debut, then distills it, cutting out the featured vocalists and paring down the runtime. The result: a dextrous blend of soul, R&B and old-school hip-hop—styles that he's only previously explored with singers or rappers—packaged in his signature dance MO.

### Stone – Dream Curtain Eternally Gentle (3XL)
> Dream Curtain Eternally Gentle adds chugging, perfectly sedate trip-hop beats to Stone's already blissfully organic ambient and squiggly IDM. "Tiny" wraps emotion into reverbed guitar and vocal blips. "Pixie" is light and pensive, with synth work and chimes that land like gentle pebbles against misty lily pads. This is one for overcast mornings and late-night drives.

### Kloke – Lucidity (Mindgames)
> On Lucidity, Kloke delivers another excellent survey of modern jungle and drum & bass. Take "Invisible City," which transitions from soaring pads to angry breaks. The album's musicality, shown on the sweet, soulful melodies of "Spaces" and "The Man Who Began To Suspect He Was Made Of Glass," is balanced by some of the nastiest basslines you've ever heard.

### Oli XL – Lick The Lens / Pt.1 (Warp)
> Six years after the release of his cherished debut album, Rogue Intruder, Soul Enhancer, Oli XL returns with another LP highlighting his glitched-out soundscapes and delightful, pitched-up vocals. This time he brings an all-star roster of guests, including james K, Chanel Beads and Ecco2k, making for a sound that leans closely to glitch pop.

### Susumu Yokota – Skintone Edition Volume 1 (Lo Recordings)
> Seven albums tracing the genre-expansive genius of Japanese ambient legend Susumu Yokota. Get lost in the delicate triumph written into the skipping piano on "Morino Gakudan," groove to the loose, hand drum-driven house of "Pegasus Man" and lollygag to the guitar-laced ambient of "23 Degrees Dream."

### Various Artists – kwia 4eva (kwia)
> In Kiana Mickles' nightlife column, Office Hours, Berlin ambient bar kwia was described as "a soft playground made for sensitive people." Now that the venue is facing the threat of closure, kwia 4ever is a sonic time capsule of the original soft club. Regular DJs Nick León, River Moon and mobilegirl contribute a relaxing medley of ambient, glitch and guitar music. Perfect for sinking into a plush couch.

### Guedra Guedra – MUTANT (Smugglers Way)
> Guedra Guedra brings together an impressive assortment of Pan-African influences on MUTANT. Asymmetrical beats meet traditional instruments; bass music meets ancient rhythms. It's the kind of memorable—and extremely danceable—album that pushes the boundaries of every genre it touches.

### Skee Mask – E (Self-released)
> Skee Mask impresses again on his surprise album, E. Intricate breakbeat science plays out on tracks like "Untitled 1017" and "501v2." Elsewhere, techno is rough-edged and deconstructed, with distorted beats lumbering forward like they're being pulled downhill.

### Florian TM Zeisig – A New Life (STROOM)
> Awe-inspiring ambient that will instantly transport you to every peaceful moment you've experienced. Waves lap up against soaring saxophone on "Eternal Shore," the delicate layers of harmonies on "Die Große Natur" recall the jubilation of the first day of spring, and on "Life's A Spiral," harp trickles down a celestial soundscape like rays of sunlight.

### keiyaA – "Stupid Prizes" (XL Recordings)
> Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. keiyaA returns with her first song since the release of her cherished 2020 debut album, Forever, Ya Girl. This sneak peek at new music brings a haunting aura to her typically soulful R&B, and gives us a lot to look forward to in this new era.

### Paurro – Sea Bunny (aanjel)
> Paurro's first EP on aanjel, her label with Valeriana, is a psychedelic journey through submerged basslines and progressive house squiggles. Listen closely as subtle layers of new sounds are introduced—a flash of a breakbeat, a trickle of a hand drum—and spritely vocals ooze out of the spaces between each curvilinear rhythm.

### JiaLing – WUPS! (Sorry Records)
> JiaLing adds a little bit of everything to the Baltimore club formula: across these four tracks, there are nods to ballroom, diva house, dubstep and electro. The EP is bouncy, filled with cartoonish sound FX that channel the silly energy conveyed through a title like WUPS!

### Tracey – Sleazy (AD 93)
> With 8-bit synths and scrappy lyrics, "Sleazy" has the deranged feel of an Adult Swim theme tune and the innovation of a SOPHIE song. Glitch by glitch, the mysterious duo paint a scandalous scene. Even if you're not quite sure what's going on, you'll be at the edge of your seat—and loving it.

### Sofia Kourtesis – Volver (Ninja Tune)
> Volver doubles down on Sofia Kourtesis's strengths. Recorded while caring for her late mother in Peru and working with queer and trans advocates, the EP offers many iterations of her joyful noise. "Canela Pura" has a bit of the old French Touch ooh la la filter that she often threads into her DJ sets, along with a skippy bassline and the backspin goofball energy of Eris Drew. Much of these tracks sound like a body in pleasure: on the ecstatic piano house of "Nitzan and Aminaa," percussion tickles the ears like a welcome hand on your back.

### Unsound Podcast 107: DJ E / Chuquimamani-Condori 
> First tested at the opening of last year's Unsound in Kraków, this mix captures the singular, hyper-charged style that has made Chuquimamani-Condori (AKA DJ E) one of electronic music's most unpredictable forces. It feels like a dispatch from an oasis far removed from the parameters of experimental music as we know it. Across 48 minutes, Andean folk, cumbia and country music are bent and spliced into a delirious wall of sound, stitched together with the Bolivian-American artist's signature soundboard FX.

> For the tenth edition of NAFF's mix series, former De School resident Jasmín swaps her usual broken bass sound for minimal house and techno. Recorded during a summer heatwave, the set layers faint voices, distorted drums and low-end pressure into a feverish atmosphere. Spanning long-time favourites (DJ Koze, Ricardo Villalobos) and recent digital finds, she leans into long, subtle blends, tapping into the ongoing resurgence of minimal's hypnotic pull.

### Animix One Hundred & Seventy Nine: Agonis 
> Basel's amenthia recordings may have carved out a niche with its leftfield, slow-burning techno, but label cofounder Agonis shows the vibes needn't be austere. Here, the Swiss DJ and producer delivers 66 minutes of colour and warmth for Kia's beloved Animalia series. Groovy, trippy selections are threaded with vocals and trance flourishes. It's a reminder that hypnotic techno can move with both depth and vibrancy, balancing ritual intensity with playful, body-driven momentum.

### ITPS119 LIMITED NETWORK 
> Max Watts is elusive. The Detroit-based artist once wiped his entire discography from the internet, which only made the buzz around him grow louder. Known for peak-time tracks and vinyl turntablism that recall legends like Claude Young, he's quietly become one of techno's most compelling underground voices. For the latest Ilian Tape Podcast, he dives into aquatic shades of techno and electro, teasing the upcoming release on his label, Limited Network.

### GQOM MIX TAPES E67 | AUGUST 2025 w/ MAMTHUG 
> "Archiving gqom, one mix at a time," reads the tagline for Oroko Radio resident Mamthug's GQOM MIX TAPES series. Emerging from Durban's townships in the early 2010s, gqom quickly became one of South Africa's most influential party genres, defined by heavy bass, stripped-back percussion and a brooding intensity. On this episode, Mamthug—usually drawn to jazzy breakbeats—leans fully into gqom's vast spectrum, moving from sensual cuts to sub-rattling bangers, highlighting both the intimacy and force of a genre that remains as vital as ever.

### Transmissions 001: Sunju Hargun 
> Transmissions, the excellent London party spotlighting psychedelic club music, books hypnotic techno experimentalists such as DJ Nobu, Polygonia and Donato Dozzy. For those unable to attend the raves IRL, the crew has started a new mix series, launching with Bangkok-based DJ and label owner Sunju Hargun. A recording from FOLD's cosier second space, the Steam Room, the session opens with ceremonial chants. Vocals twirl around body-rattling bass and eerie synth lines, eventually giving way to two hours of Hargun's unique take on trippy techno.

### In Focus: DJ Medhi (mixed by Antonine Scali) 
> NTS Radio's latest In Focus celebrates DJ Mehdi, a hip-hop-kid-turned-house-DJ who defined a generation of Paris nightlife in the early 2000s. Raised on the outskirts of the French capital by Tunisian parents, he began producing mixtapes and beats inspired by J Dilla, before emerging as an unlikely icon of the Paris party scene. His radiant selections helped stitch together disparate worlds, from Daft Punk and Justice to MC Solaar. This hour-long mix captures that alchemy: rugged, sample-heavy productions for 113, Rohff and Mafia K'1 Fry sit alongside glossy, synth-driven anthems like "Pocket Piano," culminating in the euphoric climax of Thomas Bangalter's edit of "Signatune."

### Strøm Mixx 044 - Mbizo 
> Mbizo spins an hour of his own productions for Strøm Festival, Copenhagen's long-running celebration of electronic music and sound culture. While the Danish city has in recent years become known for high-BPM techno, Mbizo carves out a different path, grounding his set in old-school steppers, digi-dub and meaty dubstep (listen out for the cheeky JME edit). It's a refreshing counterpoint—and a seriously impressive showcase of Mbizo's studio skills.

### DJ Haram – Beside Myself (Hyperdub)
> Beside Myself is a masterfully precise debut album that revels in its harshness: glowering verses, wailing strings, field recordings of a bustling New York (footsteps, incoming trains, old apartment buzzers) that crackle and simmer. The LP feels like a whirlwind night out, with influences running the gamut from Tennessee rap to Kim Gordon. It refuses to settle, sweeping listeners up into its galvanising clamour.

### Qur'an Shaheed – Pulse (Leaving Records)
> Both building on and breaking down the refined neo soul of her 2020 EP, Process, Qur'an Shaheed's first full-length flourishes in the space between craftsmanship and creativity, bucking structure for improvisational freedom. Her blend of pitch-shifted, syncopated spoken-word, fluttering hums and lo-fi glitch FX evokes the boundless jazz fusions of artists like duendita and keiyaA. Shaheed's warm timbre is versatile enough to leap from the latter's trademark looped harmonies to Outkast-esque skits.

### Various (Tectonic) – Tectonic Sound (Tectonic Recordings)
> Tectonic's latest compilation represents a compelling snapshot of where dubstep and dubstep-adjacent music stand right now. There's shuffly, soulful broken beat (2562's "Overcome"), weighty half-step skankers (J.Sparrow's "Genesys") and bassy techno tools (Pinch & Neffa-T's "This Is This Isn't"). Listening to Tectonic Sound from start to finish feels like microdosing the label's entire back catalogue.

### Hieroglyphic Being – The Sound Of Something Ending (Mathematic Recordings)
> In Jamal Moss's expression as Hieroglyphic Being, there are no bum notes or wrong ideas. On The Sound Of Something Ending, gritty blips and elysian arpeggios constitute the album's beating heart. Through both analogue and digital manipulation, he uses a staggering array of synth textures to convey everything from shivering anxiety to spiritual ecstasy.

### Slikback – Attrition (Planet Mu)
> Attrition, Slikback's first album on Planet Mu, explores themes of transition and reflection. Written during a relocation to Poland and the expectant arrival of the musician's first child, it's his most mature and realised work to date. The drums strike first. Violent and chaotic, his mutant programming often feels like he's flipping through a rolodex of trap and hard dance sub-genres at an accelerating pace. And yet, the LP's softer moments are among its most compelling.

### Stars of the Lid – Music for Nitrous Oxide (Artificial Pinearch Manufacturing)
> Stars of the Lid's 1995 debut album is regarded as a classic within the ambient and drone world for a reason. The record is dense enough to wrap around and colour an environment, but never too imposing. This 30th-anniversary reissue highlights the pioneering drone duo's staying power. The smudged guitar flickers on "Down" gently speak to the current moment. In the era of Spotify's anodyne functionality playlists, the majesty of a slowly undulating drone piece like "Goodnight" feels like a brilliantly comical riposte to the idea of easy-listening music. But those subtle challenges have guided Stars of the Lid from the beginning.

### Madonna – Veronica Electronica (Warner Records)
> It makes sense that Madonna is still exploring the world she created with 1998's Ray of Light. The rest of us are, too. This year alone has seen pop divas like FKA twigs and Addison Rae summon its spirit both reverentially and referentially. The LP's long-awaited remix album, Veronica Electronica, is pleasant nostalgia for the golden era of late-'90s dance music, a compact insight into who Madonna was listening to, inspired by and collaborating with when she wrote her magnum opus.

### rRoxymore – Juggling Dualities (!K7 Records)
> Inspired by New Age music and the spacey, mind-expanding work of Carl Craig in the late '90s, rRoxymore imbues her latest album with driving hooks and gorgeous swathes of pads. From the glittering techno of "Moodified" to the alien chug of "Solace," this is an album that will guide you through trippy visions across all tempos.

### Two Shell – IIcons (Young)
> On IIcons, anonymous trickster duo Two Shell find a happy medium between their newer hyperpop-influenced sound and the UK bass that defined their early career as producers on Livity Sound. The album (likely named in reference to their 2022 EP, Icons) swings from poles with an almost comical severity. "beeep" sounds straight out of the London underground, lurching forward with skippy drum programming and blustering sub-bass, while "w a k e u p" pulls from Eurodance, all chintzy synths and zooming melodies.

### Sugar Free – Disociando (Icelab)
> Sugar Free's debut EP mirrors her provocative DJing style. Borrowing from prog house, electro-soldered techno and '80s sleaze, Disociando is one of the year's best club 12-inches. Its darkness is most palpable on the B-side. "Vale" starts with skippy, Perlon-style drum programming, only to morph into the claustrophobic techno that's become synonymous with the Montevideo scene. "Mentalizate" merges DJ Nobu's psychedelia with contemporary minimal. It feels weightless, as if you've entered a gravity-free chamber.

### Danny L Harle, PinkPantheress – Starlight (XL Recordings)
> Danny L Harle's 2021 Harlecore LP was a post-pandemic work that fed off internet rave as much as happy hardcore and early '00s Eurodance. He brought it to life with alter ego MC Boing, whose high-pitched voice bore a striking resemblance to the CGI-animated Crazy Frog. He's since worked with real-life artists such as Caroline Polachek, Oklou and now PinkPantheress. Opening with ominous choral pads, "Starlight" makes use of PinkPantheress's saccharine, Auto-Tuned vocals, creating a misty atmosphere amid the relentless energy.

### FKA twigs – Perfectly (Young)
> A Eusexua deluxe LP appears to be on the way. It doesn't take long to deduce that the pop auteur's new single, "Perfectly," is an alternate version of album cut "Perfect Stranger." The charging chords of the original are underpinned by a torrent of techno kick drums, turning the garage pop song into the kind of track that would fill a concrete dance floor at your favourite rave.

### Siavash Amini – Caligo (Room 40)
> Anchored by spectral snippets of two of the earliest piano recordings in Iran's history, Caligo is a reconfiguring of a historical document that shifts between dark ambient and noise, burying deep into the brain. Water droplets flood piano plinks ("Spiraling P.M.") and the sound of tape unraveling hisses through clattering instruments ("Sanguis Stilla"). Moments of quiet are eventually uprooted, unveiling the chaos lurking underneath.

### Command D, Zara – Gravity Reset (Butter Sessions)
> Command D makes dub techno with tight, pointillist drum programming that adds a distinct sharpness to his sludgy, sub bass-driven atmospheres. Zara makes tactile IDM with intricate sound design you can get lost in. Together, the two producers combine the heaviness of Command D's work with the squirming needlepoint embellishments of Zara's catalogue.

### tiro! – Mountain Loop // Forest Loop EP (Self-Released)
> tiro! was gifted with a fascinating ear for loops. His music is bubbly and life-affirming, carrying the laid-back groove of second-generation Chicago house even though he's based on the other side of the world in Johannesburg. "Went on a hike and got inspired," he shares on the two-track EP's liner notes. The lush, repetitive churn of life experienced on those nature walks are all over this record, from the sunny synths on "Forest Loop" to the melody on "Mountain Loop," which flies between flangered chords and woody percussion.

### Patrick Holland – In Memory (Verdicchio Music Publishing)
> Patrick Holland's recent records have been about slowing down; cruising house tracks that pack more melody than kick. This EP's opener, "Fast Forward," marks a noticeable shift in energy level, with a glitchy drum pattern and revved-up acidline. "Classless Act" tempers the A-side's peak-time palette, grooving to a restful pace with dubby pads and chirpy house drums.

### Pangaea – Manía / Neuromance (Hessle Audio)
> Is there a vocal Pangaea can't work with? The Hessle Audio cofounder makes dance floor destroyers with undeniable roots in UK bass, and "Manía" is another banger on the docket, making use of Jazz Alonzo's seductive Spanish vocals over high-octane grooves. "Neuromance," pitched at 155 PM, features a storming synth pop melody that's enough to excite even the moodiest clubber. The cherry on top? Chipmunk vocals.

### Jubilee – FreaQE (Magic City)
> On FreaQE, Jubilee plays a game: how many genres can you fit into a three-track EP? "Ford Focus" merges Miami bass's 808s, the slithery synth lines of UK bass and East Coast club amen breaks. The title track bounces with the fervour of Jersey club, while acid house synths and dubstep subs create a ferocious energy. And "FreaQE (NIGELTHREETIMES' HORNY OPERATOR REMIX)" is the drum & bass edit DJs will want to keep in their back pocket.

### 8 Deck Technical Mix 
> Neffa-T's 8 Deck Technical Mix is a stunning showcase of the continued potential of mixing records. Never one to rest on his laurels, the CDJ wizard's latest filmed session is 80 minutes of jaw-dropping skill. More than just a numbers stunt, his use of eight decks and two mixers allows for razor-sharp cuts and the spontaneous recomposition of tracks in real time, blurring the line between DJing and live performance. Almost constantly moving, it's as transfixing to watch as it is to listen to. Much like Jeff Mills' seminal Exhibitionist series, this is a vulnerable, high-wire act of solo mastery that will be talked about for years. Just remember the popcorn.

### Heaven is in You 
> ADAB is one of the US's best (and most underappreciated) DJs. On the latest instalment of their NTS Radio residency, the Philadelphia-based artist explores some of their favourite contemporary amapiano cuts from the likes of Thebelebe, Lowbass Djy, Jazza MusiQ and Bukzin Keyz. Focusing on darker, more innovative strains, it's a compelling exhibition of the South African genre today.

### Hessle Audio - 30 June 2025 
> "It's experimental music that people have to move to." So said Ben UFO back in 2016 when reflecting on A Made Up Sound's unique appeal. For a decade, the musician's catalogue was home to a wild alchemy of sounds—take "Afterhours," a lurching, 12-minute hybrid of dubstep and Detroit techno—that inspired total awe in his contemporaries. Though the Dutch producer has kept a low profile in recent years, his latest project, ex_libris, proves that his guiding ethos of innovation has only deepened. His two-hour Hessle Audio takeover, which explores a range of personal favourites and early influences (Mary J. Blige, Krust), is a markedly intimate offering from an artist who's long thrived on bending boundaries in every direction.

### NTS Iran Special 
> On her recent NTS Radio show, Maral stitches together an hour of Iranian folk and classical music, the ghostly ambient washes of Grouper and her own blown-out electronics. In her own words, the Iran Special mix taps "into the liminal feelings of being in the diaspora—a blend of sadness, anger, fear and nostalgia. A cathartic mix for anyone in the world." An essential and absorbing listen.

### The Lot Radio 06-27-2025 
> Last month, after travelling stateside on a ship, Nono Gigsta made a stunning debut at Dripping. Afterwards, she headed to The Lot Radio to prove why she's got the widest range in the game. Her ability to infuse eccentric elements into dance music is particularly unique—breaky techno suddenly morphs into ghostly drone; sombre organ notes give way to zany synth patterns. In her hands, anything and everything is possible.

### Good Work – 12 July 2025 
> Loidis has an uncanny ear for deep tech house gems, the kind with slippery grooves, punchy synths and foggy dub rhythms. These delightfully minimal cuts form the bulk of this four-hour set at Brooklyn's Good Work. The Kansas native, AKA Huerco S., has plenty to show off, never lingering on one strain of tech house for too long. His style goes way beyond traditional mnml (though there's plenty of that in here too), incorporating raw funk, slinky drums and weirdo house to devastating effect.

### Timeless Series #52 
> This ambient and downtempo session is a mental massage for knotty thoughts. Ethereal pads, lush soundscapes and nature noises (frog ribbits, the plink of water droplets) seem to capture a time-lapse of a tropical ecosystem. Over the rhythmic chug of distorted synth lines, hissing melodies and barely there vocal samples, Moopie soundtracks a rainforest in transition, taking listeners across the seasons. It's an hour of pure, contemplative bliss—and a critical ear cleanse.

### Truancy Volume 353 
> In the hands of james K, music becomes emotional architecture. Layering melancholy, surrender and longing alongside murkier feelings such as anxiety, the New York-based artist builds sets like an urban planner of the heart. This 74-minute trek across mediative downtempo, drum & bass and sample-based experimentalism finds through lines between artists on the opposite sides of the dance music spectrum, from the delicate piano notes of Tristan Arp to Marco Shuttle's quiet percussion. It ends on a bittersweet note with the IDM pop of Cybermission's "Deep Hard," which james K described as her "current favourite feeling" because "it's fun, beautiful and real."

### Black Sites – R4 (Tresor)
> On R4, Helena Hauff and F#X recapture their legendary live-wire energy for the breeziest club record in Hauff's discography, and the danciest in F#X's. The album—the duo's first release in 11 years—provides plenty of opportunities for them to break out, like the crushingly heavy electro of "II," with its Nine Inch Nails-style distorted kick drums and curdled synths. "707," all jagged edges and jutting angles, sounds like they tried to make the ugliest acid track possible.

### Introspekt – Moving the Center (Tempa)
> For her debut album on the storied dubstep label Tempa, Introspekt commits to actualising dubstep's sensual potential by incorporating elements of house, Detroit techno, UK garage and East Coast club. Her convergence of influences, from soulful shuffle to garage-grime, evokes Big Apple Records and early FWD>> parties, but without becoming bogged down in bland revivalism. Just listen to the thick, rolling riffs of wobble bass on "Make Me Dance" and "Respect," which channel the broodiness of Plastician's early tunes.

### Lyra Pramuk – Hymnal (7K!)
> While working on her third album, Hymnal, Lyra Pramuk was moved by the beauty of the nature that surrounded her. Collaborating with a string quartet for the first time, she included flute, double bass and raw, improvised vocal harmonies that contrast with sleek electronic production. The resulting LP is multitudinal: tactile and knotty yet fluid and trance-like, offering all the forward-looking potential of electronic music while also drawing from generations of folk traditions.

### Nadah El Shazly – Laini Tani (One Little Independent)
> Spanning past and present with a singular unearthliness, Nadah El Shazly's filmic scope on Laini Tani reveals the intense curation of an auteur. The album opens with a deceptively dream-pop bent before blossoming into a genre-spanning ride of industrial, classical and trip-hop. Her lyrics come alive with the hustle and bustle of Cairo (her hometown), her interiority and the interplay between the two.

### DJ Bone – DJ Bone XXXV: The End of Never (FURTHER)
> In late May, DJ Bone decided to put out a whopping six releases to celebrate his accomplishments: five years of his FURTHER label, 30 years of his Subject Detroit label, 35 years in the music industry and, most importantly, his 55th birthday. The End of Never, the first of the six, offers more energy than his previous LPs, crackling with the futurism and thrust of the best Detroit techno. Take "Critical," which consists of little more than drums, a squelchy, two-chord Juno stab and hip-hop-coded vocals. It feels like mainlining a double espresso.

### Polygonia – Dream Horizons (Dekmantel)
> Polygonia's latest unfolds like the sci-fi film Annihilation, where the DNA of living organisms is refracted and reconstituted into forms that are mutated and haunting yet somehow still gorgeous. Her soft-focus atmospheres offer moments of introspection, while earthly textures become anchors as she observes her ephemeral worlds. In these dreamscapes, highlights like "Gate To Amygdala" and "Hidden Blue" reveal just how intricate the Munich-based act's sonic craftsmanship is.

### Purelink – Faith (Peak Oil)
> Purelink's new album of glitch and ambient techno rewards listeners willing to sit with quiet. Over time, the record slowly reveals intricate networks of sound amid an unwavering blanket of echo and barely-there feedback. The group also fold vocals from selected vocalists—Loraine James and poet Angelina Nonaj—into the mix. Opening track "Looked Me Right In The Eye" conjures a soporific sense of nightfall. On "Circle Of Dust," it almost sounds like the trio is volleying a ball between them, a technique more befitting a jam band than an electronic group.

### Nick León – A Tropical Entropy (TraTraTrax)
> When Joan Didion set her sights on Miami during its mid-'80s heyday, she looked past the pastel-hued condos to find a new form of hybridised decay—attempts to mask state-sanctioned corruption behind the veneer of a tropical paradise. It's an unexpected yet totally apt point of reference for Nick León, a proud ambassador of Miami's dance music scene. But A Tropical Entropy is far from a dour outing. "Ocean Apart," for instance, almost becomes a full-blown EDM rager, but backs away before the catharsis of a major drop.

### naemi – Breathless, Shorn (28912)
> Following up the excellent Dust Devil, Berlin-based artist naemi releases a slimmer album, with a tighter list of contributors. Baptist Goth delivers feathery indie vocals, and Foamy transports you to a dingy DIY venue via scruffy drums. The record still highlights naemi's strengths in shoegaze and hazy guitar, while also touching on ethereal folk ("fearless girl") and metallic jungle ("maze").

### Facta – GULP (Wisdom Teeth)
> On GULP, Wisdom Teeth boss Facta weaves chillout music into his signature bright melodies and skippy rhythms. R&B-inspired synths lacquer house percussion on the cruising "Skyline 4." "terminal" is sedated airport music, while "BDB" dials up the energy with clubby 2-step.

### Isabella Lovestory – Vanity (Giant Music)
> Isabella Lovestory's second album shows the range she's developed since her debut, Amor Hardcore. On highlights like lead single "Telenovela," her braggadocious reggaeton is infused with a theatrical narrative, while further in, she sings glamorously over loungey disco ("Pill") and raps over sparkly Y2K hip-hop on "Gorgeous."

### Simo Cell – FL Louis (TEMET Music)
> On FL Louis, Simo Cell channels the garish energy of one of bloghouse's capital cities, Paris. These four tracks are a carnival ride through the past two decades of dance music—from French touch to dubstep, hip-hop to deconstructed club—stitched over erratic drum programming and imbued with bloghouse's cocaine-fueled irreverence.

### Lauren Duffus – Can's Gone Warm (Select Few)
> These six tracks are a brilliant melange of trip-hop, grime, R&B and guitar music. "Super" shows off clicky percussion and icy synths, springing around the South London artist's reverbed falsetto in a way that recalls Fade to Mind-era Kelela. The vocal hook of "N.U.M.T.E.," another clear highlight, channels the serpentine sensuality of '90s R&B before diving into ricocheting jungle.

### BAMBII – INFINITY CLUB II (Because Music)
> Arriving two years after the first, BAMBII's second volume of INFINITY CLUB takes us all around the Caribbean with a star-studded roster of vocalists. "NSYNC," featuring Skrillex collaborator BEAM, is dancehall with a '00s twist. Brazilian artist LYZZA brings baile funk to "Blue Sky." And "Mirror," with Jessy Lanza and Yaeji, explores guitar-led pop amid outbursts of jungle.

### bastiengoat – Liquor Store Lime (Self-released)
> How many times can 50 Cent's "In Da Club" be reworked for peak time? bastiengoat's "Home Burden" makes a damn good case for it. Once the reflective piano chords come in, you're reminded how the Bay Area producer can turn basic samples from water into wine.

### Surusinghe – i can't remember the name of this, but that's ok (dh2)
> Surusinghe's dynamic, percussive tunes instantly teleport you to a strobe-lit dance floor. With a short, chipmunk sample looped over synths that sound like rubber bands, "FTRW!" is the kind of track that lights up festival stages. "Wolfgang" is similarly energetic. As a tunnelling loop bubbles up at lightning speed, techno kicks transport the cut to the dark, shadowy corners of the club.

### The Wednesday Alternative Mix 
> Look for an apt description of FFAN's style, and "adult-oriented disco" might fit best. It was originally coined to describe the music of Prins Thomas, whose tracks appear in this high-energy hour of The Ransom Note's Wednesday Alternative Mix series. The term feels just right for the Nyapi owner's eclectic sound. Across the hour-long mix, the Seoul-based DJ maintains a medium tempo, blending dark, flamboyant elements—from gothic synths and vocals to acid flourishes and suspense-filled drum arrangements.

### Oceanic at Garage, Horst Arts & Music 2025 
> One of the most memorable sets at this year's Horst Arts & Music wasn't on the festival's main stage, but its most intimate. In a low-lit corner of Garage, Oceanic delved into the wonky side of house music—strange vocals, minimal classics and beatless synth workouts. Featuring Laurie Spiegel and Skee Mask, the two-and-a-half-hour recording is melodic and weightless in parts, heavy and heady in others—but consistently elevating.

### GYSTMIX-030 
> Gay Felony is the alias of Melody Scallion, a longtime force in LA's dance music underground. Her sets, like this one for the increasingly essential Gyration Station series, are deliberately fast and ecstatic, moving through upbeat house selections that wouldn't be out of place in an Eris Drew and Octo Octa set. It's an intentional choice to queer the floor, collapse binaries and dive headfirst into transfuturism.

### Everything reminds me of dubstep pt. III - curated by livwutang 
> Everything reminds me of dubstep is a series that reimagines the UK-born genre through its softest moments—the bridges, outros and tender undercurrents. For the third instalment, New York-based DJ (and former Resident Advisor staffer) livwutang curates a playlist which Beatrice M. then assembled into a mix that foregrounds lush, sweeping melodies and emotional density. It's a love letter to the genre's range—a reminder that dubstep has always been just as much about feeling as force.

### ITPS117 
> Commodo's entry into the Ilian Tape podcast vault spotlights the darker fringes of bass music. Featuring TRG's "Broken Heart," Rene Wise's "Don't Care" and Mala's "Tombstone," his selections are simply bananas, running the gamut from techno rippers to dubstep classics and back. He includes several of his own productions—most notably, "Shake and Lurk" and "89! Gloom!" from a new EP with Gantz—alongside standout picks from artists like TMSV, Hijinx and Kuedo.

### Rio 015 - Adi (recorded live at Bonanza 2025) 
> Set in the lush surroundings of Buritaca, Colombia, Bonanza Festival has quietly become a key meeting point for Latin America's electronic community. Adi, born in Bogotá and now based in Brussels, has built a steady following for her blends of trippy house, electro and techno, tinged with acid. Taking over from Nicolas Lutz at 7:30 AM, she kept up the momentum with nimble rhythms and just the right amount of sleaze, squelch and restraint.

### IT.podcast.s14e04: BMG at No Way Back 2025 
> If Detroit's Movement Festival is a pilgrimage, then No Way Back is its sacred ritual. The annual Tangent Gallery gathering is special for everyone involved, chiefly the DJs, who always go the extra mile. Motor City legend BMG is no exception. This year, he debuted fresh hardware remasters and exclusive edits of Pink Floyd, 808 State and Aphex Twin, alongside forthcoming releases on Interdimensional Transmissions. As he said himself: "We start at the Tangent and end up travelling to the other side of the universe."

### Deep House, Electronic & Broken Beats on a Tuktuk (Pam Anantr)
> On Bangkok's TukTuk Radio, DJs play CDJs while cruising around the Thai metropolis on a tuk-tuk. The latest episode features Pam Anantr, a staple of the local club scene and cofounder of Salon Kiku. For a captivating hour, she indulges in broken drums from the likes of Mia Koden, plus jazzy house à la Paul Johnson and Pal Joey.

### Various – Planet Mu 30 (Planet Mu)
> The influential UK label marks 30 years with a typically eclectic, forward-facing trip through footwork, IDM and experimental. Zoning in on new unheard music from its 2025 band of musical freaks, Planet Mu 30 is loaded with the kind of leftfield experimentation that established its reputation. Expect heaters from RP Boo, Traxman, Jlin and more.

### Erika de Casier – Lifetime (Independent Jeep Music)
> The alt-R&B artist's fourth album crystallises her tastemaking without ever sacrificing style for substance. Written and produced entirely on her own, Lifetime is a confidently self-referential record that goes with her own flow, settling into sensual downtempo that somehow manages to sound both effortless and studied.

### Kara-Lis Coverdale – From Where You Came (Smalltown Supersound)
> Kara-Lis Coverdale's first album in eight years draws heavily from programmatic music, a classical style that gained traction in the Baroque period. Each song shares dozens of small stories, filled with enough peaks and troughs to fill out a beat sheet for the next season of The White Lotus.

### PinkPantheress – Fancy That (Warner Records)
> Fancy That is a cheeky romp through UK dance pop history, sipping from everything on the Y2K singles charts—from the digital glut of Spiceworld to the trance vortexes of Frankfurt producer Spicelab. Colours get dialled up to maximum saturation as PinkPantheress splashes into full-hearted, unguarded pop for the first time.

### Model/Actriz – Pirouette (True Panther Sounds)
> Casting aside their previously hard-edged bravado, New York band Model/Actriz embrace vulnerability with confidence and a newfound lightness on Pirouette. They've dubbed it a dance pop album, manually aping drum machines and introducing earworm hooks. The LP still has the band's no wave dissonance and twisted bacchanalian throb, but some seriously operatic vocal moments demonstrate a real willingness to take the armour off.

### Surgeon – Shell~Wave (Tresor)
> What does techno mean to a 30-year-plus stalwart of the sound? For Surgeon, it's a spiritual collaboration between humans and technology, past and future. Shell~Wave bottles his personal experiences with his machines and delivers it to listeners with the improvisation of a free jazz musician.

### Various – Road Fever: New Generation Carnival Riddims From St. Lucia And Dominica (Soundway Records)
> This compilation is an invaluable snapshot of two rising genres—St. Lucia's Dennery segment and Dominica's bouyon—dissected to a clinical degree. Road Fever is a testament to the Caribbean's continuous innovation, ingenuity and celebration of its ever-evolving musical culture.

### Shanti Celeste – Romance (Method 808)
> "Can we get closer?" So asks Shanti Celeste over a shimmery bassline on "Unwind." On her second album, the British-Chilean producer puts her vocals front and centre for the first time, fusing garage, R&B and her signature house with a disarming sense of intimacy, both on and off the dance floor.

### OSSX – WORLD KEEPS TURNING (Self-released)
> Prolific New Jersey trio OSSX are keenly attuned to the needs of the dance floor. Their debut album wholeheartedly bolsters this reputation, spreading their signature East Coast club sound—hollering vocals, shuttling snares—over samples of '90s hits that almost seem too obvious (look out for Suzanne Vega's "Tom's Diner," Cheryl Lynn's "Got to Be Real"). But in OSSX's hands, pop and R&B become club tools that any smart DJ will keep in their kit.

### Chaos In The CBD – A Deeper Life (In Dust We Trust)
> From the bossa nova swing of "Mountain Mover" to the slinky downtempo of "Barefoot On The Tarmac," A Deeper Life is breezy, crisply produced music to loosen your collar to.

### Smerz – Big city life (ESCHO)
> On Big city life, Smerz finds a cohesive sound that elevates their place in the Norwegian experimental scene. By leaning into guitars, hook-driven R&B and low-slung electro, they've strengthened their storytelling chops (as on the string-led "Feisty" and the romance of "You got time and I got money") while keeping their loveable knack for weirdness.

### J. Albert – Return To Sender (Self-Released)
> New York producer J. Albert returns with his first proper album in years. The focus? Stoner ambient and dub techno. "Warped Mirror" offers glimpses of his lo-fi house past with deep house chords and brittle dub architecture. "22" cuts through the vibey feel, descending into an industrial ambient abyss where synths snap and hiss like high-voltage power lines. One to sink into.

### Ron Trent – Lift Off (Rush Hour Music)
> Ron Trent's first album since 2022 builds on the smooth, jazzy house that he's so loved for. Centreing bright synth lines and cruising funk tempos, Lift Off slowly dials up the energy levels, all while maintaining the Chicago legend's signature sultry cool.

### Anthony Naples – Scanners (ANS Recordings)
> There's plenty to marvel at on Anthony Naples' sixth album, Scanners. "Lifetimes" has an R&B feel to its gilded chords and an East Coast shuffle to its booming drums. "Bounce" is slick, tunnelling techno. "Somebody"'s stuttering, detuned piano notes slip intricately in and out of a punchy four-to-the-floor beat. The rhythms are tight and addictive from the start, the melodies keeping you tethered to the endless groove.

### Colombian Drone Mafia, Gibrana Cervantes – Memoria (Ambie—Tón)
> TraTraTrax cofounder Nyksan is next up on ambient sub-label, Ambie—Tón. Under a new alias, Colombian Drone Mafia, the Bogotá producer works with Mexican violinist Gibrana Cervantes to create 3D worlds. Ambient waves recede into clattering noise; nocturnal insect chirps are countered by the hum of a traffic jam. Even in the darkest passages, there's a suspended sense of hope.

### Stereolab – Instant Holograms On Metal Film (Warp Records)
> 16 years after Stereolab went on hiatus, the avant-pop band make a triumphant return. The hooks are grander, the beats are louder and their typically progressive lyrics are sharper than ever. "Melodie Is A Wound" includes a screeching horn solo over jazzy production, while "Electrified Teenybop!" is tantalisingly climactic, built on rollicking synths and percussion. Welcome back, indeed.

### Thom Yorke, Mark Pritchard – Tall Tales (Warp Records)
> Mark Pritchard and Thom Yorke's lockdown album truly reflects the period it was created in. Even when the LP is upbeat, there's a sense of foreboding. Many of the tracks have a vintage clank that recalls Cabaret Voltaire or even Throbbing Gristle at their most accessible; others float in an ambient haze. These are songs for anxious times.

### Tracey – Tracey (AD 93)
> Who is Tracey? Arguably one of the most exciting new duos of 2025. Across just four tracks, their self-titled EP covers so much sonic territory that you're left wondering who is behind all this brilliance—and when the album will drop. One minute they're deep in grimey dub with MC Riko Dan ("Sex Life"), the next they're serving up anguished indie a la Bar Italia ("Take Care"). The style experiments arrive in flashes. We only wish there were more.

### BADSISTA – CUTEBOYZ (Self-released)
> On this fiery EP, BADSISTA infuses grooves into his percussion-driven electronic music. "BBCITA LET'S TAKE A RIDE" has the playful bounce of Latin house; "PSYCODELIA" is big-room techno complete with dramatic build-up and drop. For a moment, he even pulls us away from peak time with the glittering IDM opening of "SPDRIP."

### Gigi FM – Virgo Space Acid (Sea~rene Records)
> Nestled in between the precise grooves of Gigi FM's intense techno is an organic New Age feel, delivered via an intricate tapestry of warped, minuscule sounds. Virgo Space Acid distills her hypnotic rhythms to their bare essentials, focusing on delicious loops and driving acid synths.

### Verraco – Basic Maneuvers (XL Recordings)
> Verraco knows how to twist momentous grooves into his high-speed club music. Tribal, hardgroove and raptor house all have a place in this energetic melange. But the Medellín producer is equally skilled in emphasising intricate details. His latest EP, Basic Maneuvers, shows this range. The title track races through sweaty Latin club music, while "Total" is industrial dub peppered with swirls of metallic clanks and what sounds like the shuffling rhythms of baile funk, slowed all the way down.

### Moin – Belly Up (AD 93)
> With curious lyrics like, "I guess this day… couldn't be this day… I guess it couldn't be the day," Moin's music might not be narrative-led, but it's certainly adept at setting the mood. And the vibe of their new EP is the same laid-back chic that flourishes in experimental venues and late-night cafés: spoken word, reversed instrumentation and gritty, nocturnal synths.

### GIDEÖN, Rush Davis – The Two Houses EP (HOMO-CENTRIC RECORDS)
> Two Houses is a homage to two iconic ballroom houses: House of LaBeija and House of Xtravaganza. Most notably, the vocals, coming from Rush Davis, commemorate the late trans luminaries that defined that scene in the late 20th century. Every track on this 12-inch lands with a punch, as garage house shuffles, whomping basslines and glamorous strings create irresistible dynamics beneath Davis's poetic ruminations.

### United in Flames 
> If Denmark is the current home of esoteric pop queens, then France is emerging as a worthy contender for the crown. Here, electronic darlings Malibu and Oklou link up to present ephemeral fragments of forgotten pop hits. With samples ranging from bambinodj to TikTok videos, the mix offers a glimpse into the pair's colourful minds.

### Live at Dekmantel Selectors 2021 (Beach Stage Closing) 
> "A wildly exuberant moment in the oddest of timelines." This recording from one of Hunee's first gigs after lockdown captures three hours of uninhibited joy. Opening with roaring saxophones, the set blends everything from thumping disco to the deep house stylings of Isolee, Carl Craig and Jump Source. Oh, and just wait for the Talking Heads bootleg.

### Sustain-Release Year Ten 
> CCL is a DJ's DJ—and this live recording from Sustain-Release proves it. A spoken word sample, dubwise textures and heaps of bass lay the foundation for ample genre hopping. It's sludgy, mystical and slightly emo—think James K and The Durutti Column—so it's no surprise that many reported tears on the dance floor.

### Spaces In Between: 100% Production Mix 
> Dubstep may have been born in the UK, but this session from Introspekt could convince you that the US is currently where it's at. In this hour-long mix, the New York-based producer nails the genre's signature swing and bassy whomp—an excellent preview of her highly anticipated debut album for Tempa.

### Nous'klaer Radio 40 
> Rotterdam label Nous'klaer Audio is a proper family affair, united by a shared love of windswept melodies. Its mix series is no different, with the latest edition welcoming fellow Rotterdammer and Club RAUM resident Hervé. The two-hour, vinyl-only mix is a real treat, showcasing the depth of his collection, from expansive house to underwater acid and electro.

### Kiosk Radio x The Lot Radio at Horst Festival 2025 
> A wave of Australian talent has broken through since the pandemic, bringing with it a scuttling, psychedelic sound inspired by the country's signature bush doofs. Sydney-based DJ and producer Cousin is one of the movement's standout names. This 90-minute recording, fresh from the 2025 edition of Horst, captures him leaning into the more stripped-back side of that sound, with low-slung, trippy minimalism that recalls RPR (plus the odd batida curveball).

### ED0042 
> Ekkel doesn't record many mixes, but when he does, he goes all out. As cofounder of Norway's Ute crew, he champions the kind of contemporary psychedelic trance that lights up everywhere from Bassiani to Australian bush parties. Recorded live at Everybody Trance x XTF in Lyon earlier this year, this set starts with a steady stream of trippers before diving into squelchy territory with a subtlety often missing in the genre.

### Objet Personnel 
> Düsseldorf-based DJ and Heavy Rotation member softburn offers swirling ambient and blissful beats that feel like a head massage. Swapping low-end pressure for fuzzy downtempo, this exceptional Callshop Radio show is perfect for fending off the Sunday scaries.

### SHERELLE – WITH A VENGEANCE (Method 808)
> Channelling the magic of her raucous DJ sets, SHERELLE's debut album moves through footwork, jungle and drum & bass with ease. But the record also proves that London's 160 connoisseur can take on much more. Garage 909 kicks shuffle across the pansexual anthem "FREAKY (JUST MY TYPE);" "XTC SUSP9ND3D" uses a blipping hardcore vocal before a torrent of layered footwork sub-bass floods in; and she even includes Cameo Blush's moody saxophone melody on "LOVE YOUR ENEMIES."

### Skrillex – F*CK U SKRILLEX YOU THINK UR ANDY WARHOL BUT UR NOT!!<3 (Atlantic)
> Surprise-released on April Fools' Day, Skrillex's chaotic, tongue-in-cheek fourth album plays like a seamless, drop-heavy mix rather than a traditional LP. F*CK U is stuffed with formerly unreleased productions that fans have long been hearing in his sets. Returning to his early-'10s brostep roots, Skrillex includes the roaring drops and dopamine hits that defined the era—but this time he corrects history, including dubstep veterans like Majestic and Joker.

### Jane Remover – Revengeseekerz (deadAir)
> On Revengeseekerz, Jane Remover's surprise third record, they race through their earliest, long-abandoned digicore work with newfound dexterity. Noise columns meet otherworldly, loosely stacked guitar notes. Standout "Professional Vengeance" could've been a Pixies song in another life, if the group played so hard and fast that the studio imploded. At their best, these songs join traditional emo with overblown electronics so seamlessly that you forget the American musician once debated choosing between the two.

### Barker – Stochastic Drift (Smalltown Supersound)
> On the excellent follow-up to his debut album, Utility, Barker adds acoustic warmth to his well-worn arpeggios. The LP flits between the icy, mathematical precision of a Y2K-era IDM album and woody live instrumentation. A true thing of beauty.

### Nazar – Demilitarize (Hyperdub)
> War is a central theme of Nazar's work. The lasers that blast through the redlining sub-bass of "Warning Shots," off his debut EP Enclave, were an early taste of what the Amsterdam-based producer would later call "rough kuduro." His delicate and sometimes downtrodden Dawuna-esque vocals are the most striking development of his second album, Demilitarize. Nazar's voice often steps lightly, casting glimmers of brilliance over the LP's murky kuduro waters.

### Red Pig Flower – Practice Love (Sound Of Vast)
> Practice Love is the debut album from Red Pig Flower, the Korean-Japanese artist based between Berlin and London. Here, she touches nearly every inch of the global house scene. There's the New York musicality of "Sax and Drugs;" springy prog-house on "Thisiz House Music," reminiscent of the '00s Melbourne scene; and the effusive positivity of the title track, which channels the energy of Eris Drew's Motherbeat philosophy. Practice Love is best summed up by the unifying message of the closer: "No Genre, Only Music."

### Hieroglyphic Being – Dance Music 4 Bad People (Smalltown Supersound)
> Chicago producer Hieroglyphic Being has been partying for a long time. "40 years later," he said about the club scene in Dance Music 4 Bad People's liner notes, "it's drastically different—everybody's angry!" His latest album is an attempt to change that. In the distorted, crunchy haze that typically defines his music, he brings out funky, wayward synth lines and drums. This is the kind of adventurous house that only Hieroglyphic Being can create, with each delightfully strange track centred around a perfect loop.

### Katarina Gryvul – SPOMYN (Subtext)
> Fans of Arca and Björk will love Katarina Gryvul's third album—a haunting collection of choral pop bludgeoned with mechanical kicks and horror-style digital detritus. But it's all anchored by her voice, an instrument she twists into squeals on "MERTVI ZHYTTYAM," layers into ethereal, operatic masterpieces ("SONTSE PAM'YATTI") and distorts until it sounds like roaring pads on "POLE POLYNU."

### Ploy – It's Later Than You Think (Dekmantel)
> London-based producer Ploy has consistently put out bassy, percussive dance music that many now think of as "UK techno." But on new album, It's Later Than You Think, he makes a hard left turn to take on the vast spectrum of house. There's the hardgroove-meets-house of "Admirer," and "Monsters," a throwback to the early-'90s drum work of DJ Pierre and Zip's '00s minimal. "Stringz" balances the old and new Ploy: mixing his new love of hard house with wormhole techno.

### Djrum – Under The Tangled Silence (Houndstooth)
> Djrum's last album, Portrait With Firewood, weaved sombre acoustic instruments into spacious ambient and IDM. On this follow-up, he brightens the emotional palette, creating striking interplays between melody and rhythm. The spritely "Waxcap" trills like birdsong, with bursts of squiggly percussion that never quite stay in the same place. "Out Of Dust" contains even more surprises, a shapeshifting patchwork of vocal snippets, drums and piano notes.

### Avi Loud, Liano – BAPE TAPE (Heck World Radio)
> As part of Los Angeles-based collective Dance Maniacs, Avi Loud and Liano approach dance music from unique angles. Avi Loud is drawn to Latin house, hardgroove and garage, while Liano has an affinity for breaks-driven club tracks. On their collaborative album, BAPE TAPE, they meld these influences with impressive cohesion, from "Workout"'s clipped hardgroove-leaning vocals to the Jersey indebted, booty-shaking momentum of "Bring It Back."

### Various Artists – Pattern Gardening (Wisdom Teeth)
> UK label Wisdom Teeth has long been a home for artists that make joyful, brain-tickling music. On Pattern Gardening, label bosses Facta & K-LONE take their high-spirited vision to new heights. Polygonia's video game-style arpeggios are full of delight on "(=o_o=)," while rRoxymore's "Nightbite" features softly bubbling rhythms and swirling fairy dust. Things lean harder on the album, too, such as on Daisy Moon's "Eradication," which falls somewhere between electro and seductive progressive house. A real treat.

### v1fro – Amnesia EP (Club Romántico)
> On this EP, Venezuelan native v1fro proves he's fit to carry on raptor house's legacy. Like the best of the homegrown dance genre, once the momentum starts, it drives relentlessly forward with every galloping drum loop. But he also takes the sound further. On "Amnesia," you hear snippets of house and tunnelling acid lines, while bleating synths on "Piñata" feel primed for a carnival sound system. The remix treatments include none other than Bok Bok, Coffintexts and raptor house originator DJ Babatr.

### Sleep D – Big Sky, Liquid Sun (Butter Sessions)
> Arriving just in time for Earth Month, Sleep D's latest EP is full of terrestrial wonders. "Green Thumbs" takes its sparkly ambience and downtempo pace from serene plant life, while "Acheron Caulderon" (named after the Greek underworld's "river of woe") is tunnelling techno that still maintains Sleep D's signature glistening atmospheres.

### Jump Source – JS06 (Jump Source)
> Will "On" be the song of the summer? Time will tell, but for now we're certain it's rousing dance floors. A track that features shout-outs can really get a crowd going, so with Martyn Bootyspoon's gravelly voice checking in on everyone from "New York to Milan" and the "front row getting down," this is a bona fide hit. The rest of the EP is just as strong, with "Bleach" representing classic Montreal progressive house—ebullient and driving.

### DJ MARIA., Audrey Danza – Inner Call (Proxima)
> Tokyo's DJ MARIA. makes techno that washes over you in psychedelic waves; all deep, immersive cuts with nimble arrangements. Swiss producer Audrey Danza, on the other hand, is known for storming Switzerland's underground electronic scene with her powerful take on trance and dark, progressive house. On this collaborative EP, their styles beautifully coalesce through skippy trance kicks and whirring techno pads.

### Trim – No Caller ID (Tectonic)
> In commemoration of the legendary dubstep label Tectonic turning 20, grime MC Trim and Pinch have linked up for a celebratory outing. Trim is known for making outsider grime peppered with jazz, hip-hop, soul and whatever else takes his fancy—nothing is off the cards. On No Caller ID, Pinch underpins Trim's self-aware rhymes with yet another of his musical influences: disorienting dub. Play this one loud.

### Carré – Body Shell (Tempa)
> London-via-Los Angeles artist Carré is responsible for some of the sleekest dubstep in recent years. Here, she lands on one of the genre's most iconic labels, Tempa, with a tantalising suite of minimal and melodic rollers—all anchored by wall-rattling bass weight. But heavy as it is, the productions are still elegantly roomy. Just listen to "Faded Form," which feels simultaneously close and miles away.

### PinkPantheress – Tonight (Warner Records)
> "Tonight" is the most club-ready song that PinkPantheress has delivered in some time. With crisp, balmy chords and a carefree UK garage skip, this is the artist's clear play to honour the UK underground stylings she grew up on while setting the stage for a more mainstream audience. The lyrics are deliriously fun in the way music should be in the warmer months. Expect to hear "You want sex with me? (huh) / Come talk to me (come on!)" on your local dance floor soon.

### Dekmantel Mix 487 
> Bristol has a long history of producing some of the UK's most forward-thinking dance music, and k means is continuing that legacy. Gracing the latest edition of Dekmantel's mix series with what can only be described as 100 minutes of wonky, percussive delights, it's clear confirmation that she's one to watch.

### Zjoso Live @ Golden Plains Festival 
> Tribqu founder Zjoso brought some serious soul to his two-hour set at Australia's Golden Plains Festival last month. From heads-down deep house and UKG to summery jungle and footwork, this is festival DJing at its most liberated. And don't just take our word for it—CCL called it "an immaculate and refreshing set that let me know anything was possible."

### Making Time 2024 
> John Talabot has long defied categorisation with sets that slip between genres with intention and finesse. House? Not quite. Techno? Close, but not really. Eclectic? Sure, but that barely scratches the surface. In this recording from the 2024 edition of Philadelphia's Making Time festival, one thing's clear: Talabot is fully locked in, moving through everything from sleazy acid to high-octane trance.

### The Basic Moves Of … KUBA'97 (Live at Horst Club 2025) 
> Nightlife in Brussels seems to be undergoing a renaissance. This mix captures exactly why. Recorded live in the Garage room at Horst— designed and built by Kuba'97 himself—this session dives deep into trippy textures and moods, from old Belgian EBM to minimal house. It's adventurous, challenging and a clear reflection of why the city's underground is thriving: open ears and open minds, on both sides of the booth.

### NTS Radio (Fifth World) 
> Fifth World, Ian Kim Judd's monthly NTS Radio show, explores imagined utopias. Berlin producer and SoundCloud cult hero bambinodj delivers one that's delightfully unhinged. Think ambient bliss derailed into underwater dub, bonkers mash-ups and euphoric chaos. If you're into Slagwerk, Night Slugs or Malibu, you're in for some heat. (Disclaimer: This dropped in February—but it's too good not to share.)

### SØNDR 061 
> Kampala-based Masaka Masaka steps up for Berlin's SØNDER mix series, delivering an hour of taut, twitchy techno that shows exactly why he's one of Uganda's most exciting DJs. Skittering drums, shoegaze haze and dub-soaked FX come together in a high-powered yet intricately textured ride.

### Bar Part Time, February 2025 
> Three and a half hours of soul, funk and jack from Los Angeles mainstay Colored Craig, who's on top form in this all-vinyl session recorded live from San Francisco's Bar Part Time. Kick back, relax and enjoy the irresistible sounds on show.

### Oroko Radio 
> Based in Mayotte, off the eastern coast of Africa, up-and-comer Zazu delivers an hour of searing gqom, Brazilian club tunes and dense low-end frequencies for Oroko Radio.

### Hiroshi Yoshimura – Flora (Temporal Drift)
> Hiroshi Yoshimura was a revered figure in kankyō ongaku, Japan's environmental music scene, known for creating artfully unobtrusive works like Surround and the seminal Music for Nine Post Cards. This posthumous album offers a fresh perspective on a musician best known for meditative atmospherics. In contrast to the quiet subtleties of his early records, tracks like "Maple Syrup Factory" sound like Yoshimura's equivalent of a pop song. Bouncy and engaging, Flora's playful pace actively asks for your focus.

### aya – hexed! (Hyperdub)
> The cosmic darkness of aya's debut album, im hole, is best captured by its lead single, "Emley lights us moor." The song is terrifying, comprising macabre field recordings and uneasy synths that soundtrack a mind seemingly caught between psychosis and epiphany. Three years on, the most surprising aspect of aya's follow-up, hexed!, is just how deliberately it functions as a sequel: eerie spoken-word morphs into screams, while drums and lasers clatter together relentlessly. On hexed!, she draws from metalcore, IDM and hardstyle, ditching cloistered inwardness for a cathartic expulsion of energy.

### Unspecified Enemies – Romance in the Age of Adaptive Feedback (Numbers.)
> Louis Digital—AKA Unspecified Enemies—has always looked ahead with a cynical eye. His scattered discography often references the late urban theorist Mike Davis, namechecking his interrogations of systems of power, explored in books like City of Quartz and Ecology of Fear. Louis Digital moulded the first Unspecified Enemies album from puzzle pieces of synths, samples and sequences made in the early '00s. Romance in the Age of Adaptive Feedback flips Davis's pessimism to transmit the hopeful mood of the new millennium.

### Logic1000 – DJ-Kicks: Logic1000 (!K7)
> Logic1000's DJ-Kicks entry dips into a startlingly intimate headspace. Though decades separate the release dates of her selections, her transitions grow together with preternatural symbiosis. Entries from the actual '90s—a quick excerpt from Dettinger's 1999 ambient pop touchstone Intershop, the intro to Wamdue Kids' 1996 deep house LP These Branching Moments—knit into contemporary Y2K throwbacks, like the smouldering trip-hop of a.s.o.'s "Somebody" and the ethereal downtempo of Moon Holiday's "Definitely."

### Sandwell District – End Beginnings (The Point Of Departure)
> When Silent Servant died in 2024, the tragedy triggered an outpouring of sorrow from the artists, fans and friends he touched, both as a solo artist and part of techno collective Sandwell District. End Beginnings is a masterclass in devastatingly uncompromising techno, completed by surviving members Function and Regis. Their reverb-heavy loops have always been melancholic at their core, but here, they recede further into the darkness. It's a beautiful elegy.

### Yetsuby – 4EVA (Pink Oyster Records)
> 4EVA is by far the most vibrant and dance floor-oriented of Yetsuby's solo records, finding common ground in the torrent of breaks and bass that build its rhythmic core. The UK club canon holds court on the album, manifesting as a sliding scale of extremes from the bitcrushed, whippet-pressurised subs of "SOUNDCLOUD" to the sweet and hooky pop breakbeats of "Aestheti-Q."

### Los Thuthanaka – Los Thuthanaka (Self-Released)
> At long last, the follow-up to Joshua Chuquimia Crampton's Estrella por Estrella and Chuquimamani-Condori's DJ E is here. The experimental sibling duo have joined forces on their debut album as Los Thuthanaka. The LP makes excellent use of Joshua's emotional, drone-like bass guitar work, while Chiquimamani-Condori's blown-out collages of ronroco, teclas and bombo italaque make even the most granular moments swell with hope, wonder and spirituality.

### Time Cow – Scaring 1100 Chickens To Death (Kullijhan Records)
> As a founding member of Jamaica's Equiknoxx crew, Time Cow has spent many years reinvigorating dub and dancehall for a modern generation. Recently, the producer has made a new home for his solo and collaborative work in Kullijhan Records. Scaring 1100 Chickens To Death, his debut album for the label, isn't as scary as its title suggests: clicky percussion dribbles through weighty low-end on "Guns Drugs and 800 Parrots" and synths squawk like screeching parrots on "Soca Numa."

### 8ULENTINA – SURPASSING DISASTER (SILLAGE)
> 8ULENTINA's debut LP comes after more than a decade of helping steer the Bay Area and New York underground. SURPASSING DISASTER as informed by industrial and dark ambient as the artist's Turkish roots. Arab acoustic instrumentation is threaded into haunting corridors of crushed bass and blistering kicks. The cursive whispers of a ney meld into cinematic synths on "Devotional," while rich-toned hand drums and cymbals punctuate the sinister synthline on "Desire Ruse." A spellbinding work.

### DJ Narciso – Diferenciado (Príncipe)
> Príncipe showcases another impressive configuration of Lisbon's thriving batida scene with DJ Narciso's debut LP. The producer, who's also the brain behind the collective Rs Produções, carves out a sound that carries a lilting danceability (perfectly demonstrated on "Pipipi" or "5 Do Jo") while "Underground dos Loucos" and "30 Paus" champion the more choppy, experimental edges of club music.

### Various Artists – Sueños en la Tormenta (Headroom Records)
> Bogotá-born producer CRRDR has been one of the loudest supporters of post-pandemic Latin-made club music—a movement he playfully dubbed "Latincore." This compilation he curated highlights an exhilarating blend of UK hardcore and rhythmic club sounds that fold in elements of raptor house, speed dembow and cumbia. This is music to make the floor shake—from the lightning-fast baile funk of LAZA's "Perturbação" to the steamy guaracha of Noro$t's "Déjela Sonar."

### Whatever The Weather – Whatever The Weather II (Ghostly International)
> Loraine James's fragmented music puts a heartfelt bent on glitchy IDM, gilded atmospherics and hushed, intimate vocals. But when she debuted her Whatever The Weather alias in 2022, she leaned further into her long-standing guitar and ambient influences, such as on the frigid, delicate chords of "0°C" and the skipping, airy pads of "30°C." Her second album under this name evokes images of arid terrain and sun-dappled dirt, with productions that shine with golden hues.

### DJ Python – i was put on this earth (XL Recordings)
> DJ Python's Luis alias has long been a vessel for his '90s chillout stylings, and has increasingly bled into other areas of his discography. 2023's Natural Wonder Beauty Concept project with Ana Roxanne, for example, showcased less of the "deep reggaeton" he made his name with, instead presenting a gorgeous world of detuned keys, breakbeats and melodic IDM. Python's latest solo EP, i was put on this earth, feels like a natural progression, making elegant use of bleeps, burling guitar and the low-key vocals of Isabella Lovestory and Jawnino. A meditative beauty.

### SoFTT – HaRDD (PAN)
> Rising Miami duo SoFTT make trance that conjures images of air-brushed crop tops and sweaty pool parties. On HaRDD, vocalist Kablito's sugary tone coats driving synthlines, but she completes her pop star arc with hooky songs like "Cera El Cielo." On the more vulnerable "Linda, Triste, Una Pop Star," she ponders traditional family life in Spanish, before she remembers with a laugh, "my boyfriend and I, we're DJs."

### Actress – Grey Interiors (Smalltown Supersound)
> Actress originally made Grey Interiors for Berliner Festspiele. The piece, recorded as a continuous 20-minute track, is now available to the wider public. Grey Interiors slips in and out of immersive white noise, occasionally opening up little pathways of clear-eyed melodies. Surreal piano and chimes break through, then dissolve into the darkness once again. It's the soundtrack for a scene in constant motion.

### Maara – Big Whoops (Ancient Records)
> As a sapphic experience, Big Whoops is an EP that exists in the slinky continuum between cuddly slumber parties and late-night raves. Undecipherable whispers flower in the cracks of proggy rhythms; gasps of delight echo through the mix. As proven time and again with Maara's work, it's the little details that make for the grandest displays of seduction.

### MoMA Ready – MR001 (Self-released)
> The agenda of MoMA Ready's first record of 2025? Gritty, romantic house. The New York producer leaves behind samples to put his own words front and centre, bringing earnest poetry to songs like "Suddenly," where love begets feelings of self-acceptance ("I feel like I belong / And there's nothing wrong"). The emotional tone of the EP—and the ecstasy it chases after—is no less driving than his peak-time anthems. On "Feel Like That," over a nasty bassline that slithers close to the floor, he asks, "How do you feel?"

### 1OO1O – BREAKBEAT BOUTIQUE (DistroKid)
> Mexico-based producer 1OO1O makes hardgroove inspired by the Latin rhythms around him. BREAKBEAT BOUTIQUE pays tribute to his US influences—tracks like "Jupiter Jazz" (sharing a name with the song by '90s Detroit techno group Galaxy 2 Galaxy) pay tribute to techno's origins while adding a playful touch of disco and funk. "Derby City Classic" pushes the envelope further, creatively connecting the dots between hoover, hardgroove and garage.

### Jlin – B12 (Jlin Metalabel)
> Sydney's Powerhouse Museum is home to half a million objects. Its new initiative, Sounding the Collection, allows musicians to access this archive and use samples recorded at the museum to create their own original musical responses. On B12, Jlin makes use of a talking robot, an Irish harp and a wire-tying machine, with hazy melodies grounding the rhythmic chaos. This might just be the closest thing to hip-hop she's worked on in recent years.

### Pixl & Peeb – Old Citrus (Future Retro London)
> Tim Reaper's Future Retro label is a place for the jungle producer to release the work of peers he deeply respects. Projects are formed out of conversations about music, or in Pixl & Peeb's case, music that Reaper plays on his NTS Radio shows. After a year of being sent Pixl & Peeb's music, Reaper decided to release Old Citrus, a collection of soulful jungle with harmonies shrouded in R&B melodies.

### Jorg Kuning – Elvers Pass (Wisdom Teeth)
> Welshpool-based producer Jorg Kuning puts house, bass, techno and electro through the blender. His latest EP for Wisdom Teeth is replete with burbling, groovy tracks that sound delightfully froggy. The synths are bright and flashy, but the slippery beats and thumping subs deepen the mood and bring listeners closer to the dance floor. A real treat.

### The Dubstep-Tech House Connection (Beatrice M. & Appleblim)
> The Paris-based BAIT label boss Beatrice M. has emerged as a key figure in reshaping dubstep in the 2020s, picking up where pioneers like Peverelist and Pinch left off. Their fascination with "techy" dubstep and the history of crossover sounds, dating back to the early 2000s, informs this NTS Radio broadcast, which is part mix, part talk show. Beatrice M. blends tracks with insights from Appleblim, and discusses the genre's evolution from dubstep's deeper, soulful roots to its influence on minimal and tech house.

### 8˚C (Richard Akingbehin)
> Unless you've been living under a rock, you've likely heard whispers that dub techno is back. Richard Akingbehin, the expert in our recent history of vocal dub techno, dives deep into the genre with a 90-minute mix that immerses you in its signature reverb and hypnotic depth. The Kynant Records boss puts it best in the accompanying interview: "One of my most used words to describe the feeling of a track is 'underwater.'"

### The OONTS Show (Kojay & P-Lucas)
> Rinse FM residents Kojay and P-Lucas continue their stellar run on The OONTS Show, rolling out an hour of blissful and bumping house. Keep an ear out for Jovonn's deep house masterpiece "Little Drummer Boy," straight from the vinyl collection of Kojay's father.

### BFC ADE 2024: RADION Saturday (Marcel Dettmann & Ogazón)
> Last October, two generations of techno collided as Ogazón and Marcel Dettmann went head-to-head for four electrifying hours at Breakfast Club's ADE takeover of RADION. The real star of the show was the crowd, who lapped up the world-class house and groove-driven techno. As Ogazón reflected, the duo were so deeply connected to the audience that it felt like "a homecoming—warm, familiar and charged with energy." of the audience that it felt like "a homecoming—warm, familiar and charged with energy."

### Baalti - NTS (Baalti)
> Just before releasing their outstanding new EP Mela last month, New York duo Baalti went deep on India's sound system music for NTS Radio. A bespoke blend of Indian and UK club music, it's a hi-octane hour of unreleased originals and hard drum highlights that are as loud as they are proud. (Full disclaimer: OK, we know this dropped in February, but it was too good to leave out.)

### Live At Podlasie Chicago (Lefto Early Bird & Marco Weibel)
> Brussels-based DJ Lefto Early Bird and New York's Marco Weibel played a rowdy back-to-back at Podlasie Club in Chicago earlier this month, delivering just over an hour of peak-time madness. They kept each other on their toes, stitching together grime, disco, subby techno and heart-warming deep house.

### Live @ The Spookathon (DJ Sweet6teen)
> It's hard to believe that DJ sweet6teen only started collecting records during the pandemic. Just take one listen to this 98-minute recording from spooky season's unofficial mascots, The Ghost Halloween, and you'll see what we mean. Designed to feel like "someone breaking into your house," it's wicked stuff—a haunted house soundtrack, but in Ibiza. Sleek deep house and rolling tech-y grooves give way to punchy, spine-tingling electro, keeping things tense yet effortlessly cool.

### Carnaval Novo Affair ✿ São Paulo (Kontronatura & Nick León)
> Kontronatura, resident at São Paulo's Mamba Negra party, went back-to-back with Nick León to close out Novo Affair's Carnival celebration with a tour de force of contemporary club music. They built the vibe with patience, moving from murky, percussive cuts—66's "Alarma (Sylvere Bouyon Edit)" and DJ Fucci & Jensen Interceptor's "Manita de Gato"—into a string of sharp, driving selections, from storming electro (Identified Patient's "My Way [Hilton Mix]") and pop-infused club (LSDXOXO's remix of Kelela "Soft") to Baltimore club (Ase Manual's "Senzu").

### Marie Davidson – City of Clowns (Deewee)
> In 2022, Marie Davidson became obsessed with Shoshana Zuboff's groundbreaking book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism. So much so that Zuboff's alarming arguments about human exploitation informed the mechanical breaks and electro arpeggios of the Canadian artist's sixth LP. Nevertheless, Davidson's furiously winking humour remains the star of the show—just listen to tracks like "Sexy Clown" and "Push Me Fuckhead."

### Traxman – Da Mind Of Traxman Vol.3 (Planet Mu)
> Chicago legend Traxman has seen his city's dance music scene through numerous iterations—from funky proto-house to ghetto house to footwork. Since 2012, the ever-prolific producer has been archiving his discography in the Da Mind Of Traxman series. After a ten-year hiatus, he returns with a collection that highlights his ghetto house past as much as his footwork present.

### Oklou – choke enough (True Panther Records)
> Oklou's debut album lures her away from the Stockholm syndrome of the internet. choke enough sees the Parisian singer venture outside—in a world so beautiful, a mid-drive sighting of the moon is distracting enough to make her crash her Subaru. Here, baroque pop and melodic trance beautifully coalesce to bring her frolics to life.

### BOOF – Night Blooming Cereus (BubbleTease Communications)
> Every five or so years, fans can expect a new album from Maurice Fulton's joyous, flower-themed alias, BOOF. His latest is an upbeat delight, moving through jazz, funk and house with the undeniable warmth of live instruments. But Night Blooming Cereus also weaves in darker, tunnelling techno moments that make you understand why this flower thrives at night.

### Darkside – Nothing (Matador Records)
> DARKSIDE's long-awaited third album largely stems from a process that Nicolás Jaar, Dave Harrington and new member, drummer Tlacael Esparza, refer to as the "nothing jam." During these sessions, the trio practiced mindfulness and reflected on the contradictions of nothingness. The result? Warbling, guitar-fuelled songs that explore how nothing can mean everything in a crumbling world.

### Kelela – In the Blue Light (Warp Records)
> In May 2024, one of Kelela's dreams came true. The alt-R&B artist—who as a college student once drove from Washington D.C. to New York to visit Blue Note—finally made her debut at the historic jazz club. This live recording is a tender treat, offering acoustic reworks from Cut 4 Me, Take Me Apart and Raven.

### Various Artists – Bay Area Renegade Trax Vol. 2 (NO BIAS)
> Bay Area-based label and event series NO BIAS thrives off cheeky, bombastic bangers. Featuring members Bored Lord, bastiengoat, Honey B and JEWELSSEA, the compilation effortlessly presents raucous breaks, electro, lo-fi house and pop edits. Listen out for Amerie on Tomi Marsi's "The Wall" and all the snaps, claps and delicious detritus that makes clubbing fun.

### Ela Minus – DÍA (Domino Recording)
> What will the apocalypse sound like? Colombian artist Ela Minus contemplates the answer on her new album DÍA, which fuses the raging energy of the club with shards of coruscating post-punk. It's a feeling best encapsulated by opener, "Broken," in which she purposefully croons: "I'll keep writing melodies / To sing away the gloom that we have succumbed to."

### Saffron Bloom – Saffron Bloom (Delicate Records)
> Through his trip-hop alias, Saffron Bloom (AKA New York-based producer Sepehr) illustrates noirish, seductive scenes. Fans of Portishead and Tricky will revel in the looped murmurs of "Dirge Of The Lonely," while St. Germain lovers will enjoy the jazzy saxophone and dub techno spirit of "Times Up (It's Over)."

### Byron The Aquarius – LOST VAULTS OF BYRON THE AQUARIUS VOL.1 (Self-Released)
> Byron The Aquarius is best known for jazzy house on Detroit labels like Theo Parrish's Sound Signature and Kyle Hall's Wild Oats. On LOST VAULTS, the Atlanta-based artist channels the soulful, gospel-influenced essence of '90s R&B. Guest appearances elevate the project to spectacular—from TaMiyA's dreamy harmonies on "Music" to the mystical hopscotch of the FlyLo collaboration.

### Shygirl – Club Shy Room 2 (Because Music)
> The second installment of the Club Shy series brilliantly highlights Shygirl's rap influences—just look at how comfortably she spits alongside Saweetie on the raunchy "Immaculate." This bawdy energy is only strengthened by her star cast of co-conspirators, including Isabella Lovestory, PinkPantheress and BAMBII. Inside Room 2, the club's never felt so hot.

### Baalti – Mela (Steel City Dance Discs)
> Mela, a Hindi word for "festival," is any kind of banging party that brings together strangers, friends, neighbours, colleagues and distant relatives. On Steel City Dance Discs' latest EP, New York-based duo Jaiveer Singh and Mihir Chauhan create a mela of their own, fusing the rattling sounds of Indian sound system culture with an overseas style that's nearly as piercing: UK bass music.

### Nadī, Otus – Freefall (all my thoughts)
> South London producers Nadī and Otus make music rooted in cultural exchange: weighty UK basslines and skittering breaks meet sinewy Bangladeshi vocals. On Freefall, this approach feels like second nature, seamlessly layering looped Bengali vocal samples over speed garage, dubstep, and on the gloriously chuggy title track, slippery ambient techno. Surefire DJ tools.

### Lucrecia Dalt – cosa rara (World Music)
> Colombian experimental musician Lucrecia Dalt crafts nocturnal music indebted to the unsettling soundscapes of surrealist cinema. On her 2024 album, ¡Ay!, she meditated on her heritage through sci-fi bolero. Her latest offering, "cosa rara," (which translates to weird thing) builds on this David Lynchian tension, with equally uncanny remixes from Mabe Fratti and Matias Aguayo.

### WOST – Miniteca Selvática (TraTraTrax)
> TraTraTrax's first release of 2025 comes from rising Venezuelan producer WOST. His galvanising mix of low-end and vocal samples—invoking raptor house, baile funk and UK bass—is primed for peak-time. On his debut EP, he strikes gold, inviting Ecuadorian artist Entrañas and Hessle Audio's Pangea for a suite of rhythmic club trax. This is what the future of Latin electronic music sounds like.

### MUN SING – Frolic (Illegal Data)
> MUN SING's music is typically built on a foundation of staticky synths and heaving low-end. Frolic takes these traits and fits them into a hyperpop mould, complete with all the rich songwriting the genre demands—from Katy Ketani's girlish voice soaring over Eurodance to ROOO's channeling of Mariah Carey, Hayley Williams and Grimes all at once. This is MUN SING's most devourable work yet.

### Prettybwoy – Tokyo Ice Age (SVBKVLT)
> Prettybwoy makes club music that squirms and fidgets. Composed of bright melodies and shiny percussion, his music evokes the sound of cartoon characters tip-toeing into mischief. On his latest EP, he finds the sweet spot between the acoustic and the digital: wintry piano and strings melt into futuristic plinks and plonks, creating moments of perfect tension.

### Terror Danjah Tribute (Spooky)
> Grime lost a great innovator last month with the tragic passing of revered producer Rodney Pryce, AKA Terror Danjah. Spooky's latest dispatch compiles nearly two hours of classics and deep cuts by the late artist—a heartfelt reminder of what made Pryce such a special and indispensable force in the London genre.

### Recorded at Houghton (2024) (Batu)
> Closing the Outburst stage at Houghton 2024, Batu delivered a masterclass in how to construct a set. The Timedance boss starts by moving through various shades of restraint—think minimal and stripped-back tech house á la Mark Henning's 2015 classic "Trojan"—before turning up the heat. Stay 'til the end for a final crescendo that the Bristol-based artist called "magical."

### Truancy Sessions (DJ Wiggles)
> Head of the label, mix and party series kinetic, DJ Wiggles is one of London's fastest-rising tastemakers. In her contribution to Truancy Sessions—Truants' new mix series for emerging artists—she flexes her muscles behind the decks. It's a spine-tingling affair, building up slowly from the skeletal rhythms of Azu Tiwaline and Beatrice Dillon to the ecstatic future-garage of Burial's "Truant." One for fans of Nono Gigsta or Shackleton.

### Cumulus 33 / Mixtape Discos Movimiento #28 (Cio D'or)
> Cio D'or honed her craft in the '90s at legendary Munich club Ultraschall before relocating to Cologne to fine-tune her deep, emotive take on minimal and dub techno. After temporary retirement due to ill health, she has reemerged in tandem with dub techno's renaissance via a 2024 Draaimolen slot and Kynant Records release. For Mexico City's Discos Movimiento, she moves fluidly through records old and new, from Basic Channel to René Löwe.

### FKA Twigs – Eusexua (Young)
> FKA twigs shines with a quality we haven't really seen before on her third studio album, Eusexua. Anchoring her songwriting in the canon of '90s dance music, she draws from trip-hop, IDM, electro and living room techno, though the LP's best moments reference the darkness of the club. While the LP is a response to the liberating euphoria she has experienced on the dance floor, the music is no less cerebral than on revered full-lengths Magdalene and LP1. There's a gripping seriousness about her devotion to pleasure across the album, from the trip-hop poetry on "Girl Feels Good" to the operatic runs on "Striptease."

### Khadija Al Hanafi – !OK! (Fada Records)
> It's undeniable that footwork, one of Chicago's proudest exports, has made its mark around the world, sweeping across the US, the UK, Japan and, more recently, Tunisia. Tunisian producer Khadija Al Hanafi's style is playful and light-footed, homing in on footwork's soulful elements with microbeats that have the glitchy nature of video game music.

### Voice Actor, Squu – Lust (1) (Stroom)
> Off the back of Voice Actor's 2022 debut, Sent From My Telephone, word spread about the enigmatic duo in niche dance music circles. Now, they're back with a new offering featuring Welsh producer Squu. While previous albums centred abstract storytelling over satisfying loops, Lust (1) doubles down on repetition, reducing singer Noa Kurzweil's voice to rhythmic murmurs and ASMR-like sighs.

### Ethel Cain – Perverts (Daughters of Cain)
> Reluctant popstar Ethel Cain has drawn comparisons to Lana Del Rey with her ruminations on shame and longing wrapped up in gloomy Americana. On Perverts, she excises her Southern charm, but shifts towards the power electronics of Puce Mary. Expect dark ambient, suffocating drone and guitars that sound like the Silent Hill alarm disintegrating.

### Africanoise – Cabaça (Self-Released)
> Africanoise, AKA Renato Junior, is a master of rhythm. His percussive instincts are informed by his study of candomblé drumming, which gives his modular experiments a ritualistic tenor. Somewhere between jazz, candomblé and techno, CABAÇA combines these worlds so smoothly you're left wondering how they were separate in the first place.

### Blacksea Não Maya – Despertar (Principe)
> Príncipe affiliates Blacksea Não Maya have always favoured more sluggish, moodier sounds than their label peers. On their latest release, DJ Kolt steps up under the group's alias for an album that takes tarraxo's intoxicating rhythm and slows it to a head-nodding pace easily likened to trap or trip-hop. Low-down grooves for the body and mind.

### Radart – Blips & Bleeps (Paper-Cuts)
> For nearly a decade, Naarm (Melbourne)-based label Paper-Cuts has specialised in low-slung house, downtempo and ambient techno, counting Kia, Roza Terenzi and CS + Kreme among its affiliates. The outlet's first release of 2025, Blips & Bleeps, comes from founder Dylan Batelic, AKA Radart. The LP is a breezy journey for anyone who enjoys melodic loops, lush pads and minimal breaks.

### Wata Igarashi – Kaleidoscopic (Dekmantel UFO)
> Tokyo producer Wata Igarashi is known for dealing in the sublime, whether through ambient, krautrock-influenced downtempo or lean acid techno. Kaleidoscopic closes in on the tougher end of his sound while adding the natural sounds of his environment—from crashing waves to swooshes of billowing wind. A treat for the senses.

### HorsegiirL – vip - very important pony (Three Six Zero Recordings)
> horsegiirL's 2022 EP, My Barn, My Rules, launched the Berlin producer as an antidote to the more po-faced corners of dance music culture. On vip, she adds a layer of sincerity to her exuberant blend of Eurodance, UKG and hyperpop, showcasing a pop songwriter's touch on "bby luv x3" and "the scene before the kiss xoxo."

### naffcast003 (Priori, Cousin)
> Clocking in at over six hours, this marathon recording from Sustain-Release 2024 might take you a couple of sittings to get through in full—but it's massively worth it. The expansive session contains too many highlights to count, including Ovatow's "Permutation Two," Wamdue Project's "Are You High" and a rework of James K's "Hypersoft Lovejinx Junkdream." No wonder one commenter declared: "Going to be vibing off this for the rest of my life."

### Recorded at Climate of Fear (DJ Nigga Fox)
> Climate of Fear has long been one of Berlin's best parties. At the most recent edition of the 24-hour warehouse rave, Príncipe affiliate DJ Nigga Fox kept the dance floor consistently moving with three hours of dark, percussive club energy—plus playful edits of Central Cee's "Doja" and Gala's "Freed From Desire" thrown in for good measure.

### .Freq with Mike Servito and Jeffrey Sfire (Mike Servito, Jeffrey Sfire)
> When asked about his approach to DJing, Mike Servito once said, "I don't think about it. When I'm playing, I just dive in and I'm OK." He and fellow Detroit legend Jeffrey Sfire are regular partners, linking up again for this slot on New York's The Lot Radio. The duo are on more than OK form, diving into a selection of proto-house and techno with the verve and grit that define their shared home city.

### Vision 025 (Courtney Bailey)
> How do you earn the name "Tokyo Chug Lord"? Just ask Courtney Bailey. The Japanese DJ, who got her start throwing warehouse raves on the outskirts of Tokyo, now lives in Europe. This recording at Berlin's Fitzroy is proof she's deserving of the title—just listen to how effortlessly she shifts from transcendental synths to brooding acid storms.

### GQOM MIX TAPES E34 (Soulchoke)
> If this new mix from up-and-coming South African DJ Soulchoke is anything to go by, the gqom scene remains in good health, over a decade since its global boom. Spinning tunes from the likes of Griffit Vigo, Mafia Boyz and KΣITO, the Cape Town artist highlights a rhythmic dance movement that continues to evolve in bold and exciting ways.

Balancing various textures without sacrificing depth and groove, it's one that's equally suited to home listening and the club."I recorded this mix right after I came back from my Asia tour," the Chinese-German artist wrote on SoundCloud.

"A magical closing set that naturally extended from two hours to five hours of pure heat from two DJs whose whole [lives are] this music and this culture—who could ask for more?"

### Sustain Release '23 (Ben UFO)
> Ben UFOSustain Release '23 No one does it quite like Ben. In this live set from Sustain-Release 2023, the Hessle Audio mastermind is in peak form, flowing effortlessly through the many shades of speed garage, wiggly tech house and wonky techno.

### Seefeel - Everything Squared (Warp)
> WarpSeefeel - Everything Squared The experimental band's first extended release in 13 years doesn't feel like a band trading on their reputation—the initial impression is one of change. Everything Squared finds Mark Clifford zeroing in on his production process while Sarah Peacock's vocals continue to provide a crucial human quality to the band's reliably enigmatic sound. Listen: Bandcamp

### Tinashe - Quantum Baby (Nice Life records)
> Nice Life recordsTinashe - Quantum Baby Outside the brief flirtations on Quantum Baby's singles—including of course, the viral hit "Nasty"—Tinashe's seventh album is really about striving for authenticity. The 22-minute album leans toward the hazy, subdued end of her catalogue, while still delivering on the kind of smoky, sexy numbers that we'd expect from her. Listen: Apple

### Kampire - Kampire Presents: A Dancefloor in Ndola (Strut)
> StrutKampire - Kampire Presents: A Dancefloor in Ndola Kampire has helped champion envelope-pushing East and South African music from the '70s up to the present day. On her debut compilation, she steps into the role of curator proper. A Dancefloor in Ndola is a captivating exercise in crate-diggery, setting renowned heavyweights like Samba Mapangala and Tshala Muana next to unpolished gems with gritty production values, party-ready grooves and minimal Google footprints. Listen: Bandcamp

### Loidis - One Day (Incienso)
> InciensoLoidis - One Day Huerco S. brings back his Loidis alias on One Day, a stripped-back record that shows the producer falling back in love with the art of a simple loop. Across eight tracks, he writes deep, muted and wobbly rhythms filled with the sort of gorgeous dub techno melodicism you might hear on a Shinichi Atobe record. Listen: Bandcamp

### Chrystabell & David Lynch - Cellophane Memories (Sacred Bones)
> Sacred BonesChrystabell & David Lynch - Cellophane Memories Across Cellophane Memories's 37 minutes, the pair's longstanding creative chemistry takes a new and arresting shape. Stripped of burdensome song forms and almost entirely absent of beats or easy melodies, something genuinely mysterious emerges—a mystery you'd be tempted to describe as "Lynchian" even without knowing who was behind it. Listen: Bandcamp

### Jon Hopkins - Ritual (Domino)
> DominoJon Hopkins - Ritual Jon Hopkins began his journey making "serious, emotional" music with 2021's hazy, beatless Music For Psychedelic Therapy. The follow-up to that album, Ritual, originated from music Hopkins wrote for an installation called Dreamachine, named after a 1959 invention heralded as "the first art object to be seen with eyes closed." The 41-minute composition expands into eight parts that unfurl like a guided meditation. Listen: Apple

### Laurie Anderson - Amelia (Nonesuch)
> Nonesuch Laurie Anderson - Amelia When Laurie Anderson—who first conceived of Amelia as a stage performance 24 years ago—was asked on BBC Radio 4 why Amelia Earhart's story appealed to her, the answer was simple: "She was a bad-girl pilot—and I liked that." On the LP, Anderson follows the late pilot's final flight path. The album plays like an audio documentary, drawing directly from Earhart's writing and strapping us into the plane with Earhart with shaky, surround-sound instrumentation. Listen: Bandcamp

### Various - Time Passages 10 Years (Time Passages)

Listen: Bandcamp

### Danny Daze & Jonny From Space - Tumbadora EP (Craigie Knowles)
> Craigie KnowlesDanny Daze & Jonny From Space - Tumbadora EP On Tumbadora, Danny Daze and Jonny From Space reunite for an EP that swaps the introspection of their respective debut albums for three original cuts of sludgy, polyrhythmic electro and techno. It even includes a cameo from Miami's other wunderkind, Nick León. Listen: Bandcamp

### Ciel & CCL - Tilda's Goat Stare (NAFF)
> NAFFCiel & CCL - Tilda's Goat Stare On Tilda's Goat Stare, Ciel & CCL's debut collaboration's chaotic feminist streak found a fitting anchor in the 2002 sci-fi feminist film Teknolust. Much of the EP lands with a thwack, top-loaded with precisely the kind of dusty peak-time tracks you'd find in the duo's festival sets. Listen: Bandcamp

### Dubbel Dutch - Cosmic Tone Poems (Rare Earth Tones)
> Rare Earth TonesDubbel Dutch - Cosmic Tone Poems Over a decade since Dubbel Dutch's last solo release, one of the breakthrough stars of the post-dubstep bubble returns after literally going off the grid.

Listen: Bandcamp

### XLR8R Podcast 863 (Assyouti)

### Rinse FM (Ploy)
> PloyRinse FM While he may have initially made his name releasing wonky bassbin tracks on the likes of Hessle Audio, Timedance and Hemlock, Ploy isn't one to be pinned down. On the July edition of his Rinse FM show, the Bristol-based DJ and producer demonstrates that he's equally comfortable (and excellent) at playing house.

### Freerotation 2024 : The House Of Crocodiles Part 2 (Live Recording) (Nono Gigsta)

It's the kind of eye-opening session that makes you want to listen to all her other mixes right after.

### Live at Nowadays 7 April 2024 (Objekt)
> ObjektLive at Nowadays 7 April 2024 Objekt is one of the most dynamic artists in underground techno today, and this recording—from the equally influential New York club Nowadays—captures him on typically excellent form."I played on Sunday morning from 9 AM to 3 PM, between JASSS and Bearcat," he said, calling it "one of the most creatively fulfilling sets I can remember playing–one of those sets where the audience, environment, atmosphere, tech setup, phase of the moon, whatever, all somehow lined up for a full six hours."

### Down The Rabbit Hole 2024 (Sarkawt Hamad)
> Sarkawt HamadDown The Rabbit Hole 2024 The versatile Amsterdam-based DJ covers a lot of ground in this two-hour live recording from Down The Rabbit Hole. You can hear her adventurous approach in full bloom, moving through starry-eyed house, hypnotic techno, squelchy acid and more from the likes of Peach, Polygonia and Zephyr.

### **NONO GIGSTA** - The House of Crocodiles (Live at Freerotation)
> Halfway through Nono Gigsta's sequel to her 2018 Freerotation set, also named The House of Crocodiles, we get an indication of the strange title's origins. "The males' rippling flesh sends soundwaves through the water… humans can barely hear them, but the crocodiles can. Welcome to the House of Crocodiles," a sample narrates. And then, oh so naturally, it moves into a roaring electric guitar solo (Led Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love"). It's a bonkers move that can prompt you to completely rethink what DJing can be. It's also completely natural in the hands of the Belgian DJ.Jaw-dropping transitions dominate this two-hour recording, aptly described as "Big Blend Academy" by one commenter. Low-end frequencies anchor the mix as it darts through wild variations in mood and tempo. Dubwise experiments (LUXE's "Diamond Dub") morph into frenetic jazz techno (Gigi FM's "Gabriella"), sounding like DJ Sprinkles if she dabbled in UK bass. You can feel Gigsta's sense of freedom as she aqueously glides across loose and liquid rhythms.Freewheeling mixes of this sort often risk being overly headsy, but this is a very fun listen that spans Björk, Foster Sylvers and Victoria Monet. The inclusion of more "popular music" only adds to the overwhelming sense of feverish delight. There's only one reasonable response to a mix this audacious: "WTF." - Bella Aquilina

### **Chucheewa** - Sound Metaphors (Refuge Worldwide)
> Chucheewa, one-half of Bangkok duo Acid Sister, thrives in slow tempos where she can flex her storytelling skills. In this mix, she's the sonic embodiment of an off-duty femme fatale. Balearic downtempo, acid house, dubby disco and woozy krautrock criss-cross one another like whispery marble veins, transporting listeners to a sleek, '70s-style disco where our protagonist is getting her lounge on. There's a nonchalant swagger underlining every track, as if mirroring her breezy movements. The mood is loose-limbed but there's a high degree of intellect and intention behind each rhythm, just like a Bond girl's alluringly sharp demeanour. - Nyshka Chandran

### **JADALAREIGN** - Episode 65 (There Is No Planet Earth)
> For Black History Month, New York's JADALAREIGN explored the myriad shades of deep house through a futurist lens. Selections emphasise the radical spirit behind Black music-making, whether via icy, austere melodies or the psychedelic squelches of 303s. Cruising through under-the-radar classics (Felix Da Housecat's "Free Love") and curveballs (Sweater on Polo's "Computer Controlled Madness"), the Nowadays booker zones in on tunes with a spacey touch that often borders on kooky (just look at Marcus Mixx's twisted jack track "Salut The Noize With A Laugh"). This is a concise but essential glimpse into the innovative imaginations of Chicago and Detroit artists, past and present. - Nyshka Chandran

### **Mia Koden** - One Hour of IICON (FMB Mixtape 243)
> If you caught our Glastonbury recap from earlier this year, you'll already know that Mia Koden's opening set at the IICON stage was something special. A "blend of celestial, 2562-esque dubstep backdropped by a beautiful sunset," as one RA staffer put it. For FMB, the London-based artist condensed that two-and-a-half-hour set into this lean power-hour of soulful sub-pressure. Just listen to the way she moves from the soothing resplendence of Ella Fitzgerald to the dank 140 of Slimy, Delta and Obskure within the opening ten minutes. Anything's possible in Mia Koden's capable hands. - Tom Gledhill

### **Priori** - Dekmantel Podcast 459 
> 2024 was a career-defining year for Canadian DJ and producer Priori, whose entry into the vaunted Dekmantel series blooms with spiralling, psychedelia-dipped sound design. This 90-minute session bears more resemblance to a longform song than a tapestry of different ones, applying incredible attention to detail by collaging deep and squelchy textures that sit as much in the future as they do in the past. If a snapshot could be taken of the styles that reigned 2024's dance floors, it's this: an incredibly cohesive and soft-hued marriage of nimble breakbeats, techno and trance from an artist going from strength to strength. - Chloe Lula

### **Reptant** - Floresta (Live at Waking Life)
> The appeal of a festival lies in its promise of escape from the mundane, and there's perhaps no better soundtrack to this promise than Reptant. A key figure in the electro revival, the Melbourne producer is known for a sleek, omnivorous sound that blends elements of tech house, trance and techno. His powers shine in this live recording from Portugal's Waking Life festival, which brims with otherworldly ambience. One standout at the 22-minute mark sounds as if Mike Skinner and Plastikman made an electro record together. Reptant later called it his "most special" gig ever. Check the SoundCloud comments and you'll see the dancers agree. - Bella Aquilina

### **DJ Swisha** - The Lot × Kiosk (Live at Horst)
> DJ SWISHA is currently operating at the peak of his powers. With a doctorate-level grasp of Black American dance music and UK breakbeat, he's a true mixologist with a PhD in tearing up the club. This recording proves it. Effortlessly weaving through East Coast club, ghetto house, jungle and footwork, there's an enviable ease to every blend. The feral crowd noise is the perfect cherry on top—each transition is met with unrestrained whoops and cheers. Aspiring club DJs, take notes: this is a masterclass in how it's done. - Fahad Akinsanya

### **Toumba** - FACT mix 938 
> Full disclosure: this one actually landed in December 2023. But because it slipped through the cracks of year-end coverage, and the legendary mix series shut down weeks later, we decided to bend the rules. Plus, it's totally mesmerising, the kind of mix that triggers 1,000 wormholes and—should you listen in a particularly fragile state—possibly floods of tears. This is bold, cinematic, heart-on-sleeve DJing. A long ambient first half features tracks from Ulla, Burial and Slikback before morphing into headbanging mode with shards of Verraco, Eartheater and Lil Wayne. Stick this on when you really want to feel something. - Carlos Hawthorn

### **DJ Travella** - Live at Draaimolen Festival 
> DJ Travella is the face of singeli's future. The Dar Es Salaam artist infuses techno and taarab into the famously hi-NRG genre, adding a touch of experimentalism and contemporary rave to its frenzied tempos. For many in attendance, this was a clear highlight of Draaimolen Festival and it's easy to understand why. His vibrant selections possess a sense of urgency, commanding movement through jolting synths and madcap effects. The crowd vibed so hard that Travella ended up dancing on top of the decks—a perfect picture of singeli's joyful nature. - Nyshka Chandran

### **YAJAIRA LA BEYACA & GENOSIDRA** - Misantropical (Rinse France)
> Three things are guaranteed when these two subversive powerhouses link up: an onslaught of Latin-infused bass trax, coquettish flexes about diva behaviour and an involuntary desire to throw ass. Venezuelan rave doll Yajaira La Beyaca has been on a tear since 2021, but this hybrid live set—one of her first in Europe—alongside frequent collaborator Genosidra, demonstrates an artist fully stepping into her powers. Darting through apocalyptic perreo, guaracha and what some call Latincore, this session is a soundtrack for all your freaky pre-club rituals. When Genosidra slips into a speed dembow refix of JME's "If You Don't Know"? Proof that perfection does exist. - Rachel Grace Almeida

## [The Best Tracks of 2024](https://ra.co/features/4401)
Date: 2024-12-04T12:45:45.000Z

### **DJ Love** - Bomb Tech 49 (Eastern Margins)
> Like gqom and raptor house, budots is finally joining the modest list of regional dance music genres gaining global recognition. Originating in the Philippines in the early '00s, the street-pioneered sound combines trancey techno and house with fat bass, high-pitched synths and lots of air horns.Now, pioneer DJ Love is showing off a new mutation of the classic sound with "Bomb Tech 49." Fittingly called bomb-tek, this offshoot is more techno-driven and undeniably harder, darker and leaner. Whereas the traditional stylings tend to be chirpier and whimsical, blippy effects, this strain, full of springy basslines and looped drums, takes budots off the streets and into the club. - Nyshka Chandran

### **Nuovo Testamento** - In My Dreams (Powerhouse Mix) (Eskimo/N.E.W.S.)
> "In My Dreams (Powerhouse Mix)" is the early '90s Italo house classic that never was. Pairing sugary, Latin freestyle-inspired vocals with huge piano stabs à la 4 For Money's "It's a Moment in Time," it's the kind of turn-of-the-decade anthem you'd expect to hear soundtracking grainy archival footage from Cocoricò or Quadrant Park.Except "In My Dreams" isn't from the '90s—it's a new release from contemporary synth pop outfit Nuovo Testamento. Dismiss it as frivolous if you like, but doing so won't diminish the truth: this track is custom-made for massive, life-affirming rave moments. - Michael Lawson

### **Sam Goku** - Temple Arp (Dekmantel)
> Like many great techno tracks, "Temple Arp" is a marathon, not a sprint. Stretching out over seven minutes, this beatific roller hooks you in with a cosmic intro that builds tension like a thriller. Sam Goku's previous releases, such as 2021's Tanggu and 2021's East Dimensional Riddims, have demonstrated the Munich-based producer's eye for the finer details."Temple Arp" is the stunning zenith of this meticulous approach: softly padded kicks and constellations of otherworldly synths work seamlessly to lull you into a trance, plotting a dubby voyage of epic proportions that favours nuance over heft. - April Clare Welsh

### **Leonce** - Not Here For It (Morph Tracks)
> It's one thing to produce a dance track. It's quite another to permeate it with the sheer essence of the club, transporting listeners to the dankest dance floor they've ever been on. Atlanta-based producer Leonce's incandescent banger "Not Here For It" uses effervescent keyboard arpeggios and infectious diva vocal samples ("here, here for you") to convey bodily liberation on a visceral level.When the beat drops, you can almost feel the sweat bead on your brow, as Leonce flexes not only his production chops, but his keen understanding of what makes the most seasoned ravers go off. - Cameron Cook

### **TAAHLIAH & Elouiza** - Boys (untitled (recs))
> Nothing hits like a sexy a cappella line—and TAAHLIAH and singer Elouiza delivered on "Boys." Fans of TAAHLIAH's bolshy, playful DJ sets may have been surprised by the introspection of her debut LP, Gramarye, but TAAHLIAH still made room for "Boys," the glossy, seductive club cut she's been teasing since 2022.Elouiza's smouldering vocal—"These boys, they all want me / They all want to get in me"—is adorned with a growling bassline, crashing kick drums and plasticky neon synths, resulting in a perfect balance of cheeky yet tough. If 2024 served us up a track for stomping around the city feeling hot, this is it. - Katie Thomas

### **1OO1O** - Del Salsódromo al Rave (self-released)
> What happens when you throw "Talento de Televisión" by salsa legend Willie Colón into a blender with Nightcrawlers' '90s house anthem "Push the Feeling On"? Possibly the most fun you can have on a dance floor.Mexican producer 1OO1O has been steadily ascending with his tropi-fusions of salsa and breaks, expertly folding the Caribbean genre's rhythmic principles into techno and bass music—all with a puckish wink. But "Del Salsódromo al Rave" takes this formula and intensifies the flavour. A base layer of Nightcrawlers' immediately recognisable synth line, a dash of Colón's warming trumpet ensemble, all bound by pummelling, hip-vitalising kicks at 150 BPM. Delicioso. - Rachel Grace Almeida

### **INVT & Introspekt** - Seismic Activity (ec2a)
> The global club music cross-pollination was in full flow long before Miami duo INVT and neo-garage innovator Introspekt decided to make music together, but the resulting EP, Tectónica, is nevertheless one of the explosive statements in recent memory.It's a quality three-tracker, but opening cut "Seismic Activity" is the one that truly stands out as the jewel in the crown. The trio find a rousing middle ground between their respective styles of Latin-fortified tech house and buoyant UKG, enhanced by a slowed-down sample from Salt-N-Pepa's "Push It." This is dark and lusty 2-step capable of, well, shattering dance floors the world over. - Michael Lawson

### **HiTech** - SPANK! (Loma Vista)
> HiTech know how to keep cool under pressure. This is key to the trio's marriage of heart-palpitating ghettotech with laid-back rapping: their ability to float atop 150 BPM sizzlers with pure control. "SPANK!" pushes that contrast to the max, overlaying a dizzying central bongo loop with programmed keys, synth flares and laser FX.But it runs on GDMRW and King Milo's verses, traded off drill-style in attempts at getting their hands on a triple threat: "She got beauty / She got brains / She got booty all in that thang." Sure, "bend it over, let me spank," isn't the subtlest come-on, but HiTech's flow makes it seem almost elegant. The end result is as sexy and tactile as the palm-to-ass communion. - Hattie Lindert

### **Claire Rousay & Lala Lala** - please 5 more minutes (Thrill Jockey)
> There is an inherent melancholy in having to ask for more time; an underlying sense of defeat in prolonging the inevitable. And though experimental composer Claire Rousay is not above having to “beg” for it, as she candidly croons on electronic ballad “please 5 more minutes”—a standout from this year's sentiment—she wrings clear-eyed dignity out of an act of vulnerability.Combining purposeful guitar with heavily Auto-Tuned vocals, Rousay modifies the self-described "emo ambient" textures of her early work into a cyber-folk vignette that pierces your heart and subverts your ear. Its emotional clarity is overwhelming; the track abandons words for a climax of hymnal chords which slowly fade into a denouement of silence. Time, as it must, has run out. - Jake Indiana

### **Joker** - Juggernaut (Kapsize)
> 2024 was filled to the brim with throwbacks to that foggy period in the late '00s when dubstep was being transformed. This British bass revival also meant that when Joker dropped a 140 BPM monster, he'd arguably never sounded more contemporary. "Juggernaut" is classic Joker: ethereal strings and anthemic horns twist over sparse drum programming and distorted bass so nasty it could make Howard Stern blush.What keeps "Juggernaut" from being a nostalgic victory lap is how he turns everything up to 11. He's had big drops before, but nothing as gargantuan as the lift-off a minute into "Juggernaut." This is "Tron" for a whole new generation. - Henry Ivry

### **Moktar & Saad El Soghayar** - Haraka حركة (Astral People)
> "Haraka حركة" is a monumental convergence between Moktar and Egyptian Mahraganat luminary Saad El Soghayar. Translating to "movement" in Arabic, the track is a unique and powerful meeting point of two street-born genres that embody celebration, cultural resistance and community. Moktar has weaved El Soghayar's wedding anthem into a tapestry of traditional darbuka rhythms and drum & bass, creating a rhythmically rich dialogue of tension and release.Moktar has managed to span meridians, creating a knockout that echoes the venn diagram of heritage and contemporary dance music. From Cairo's DIY block parties to London's pirate radio, "Haraka حركة" is a testament to how the underground has always spoken the same language, no matter where it calls home. - Ramsey Tawil

### **Tinashe** - Nasty (Tinashe Music/Nice Life)
> Janet Jackson owns the word "Nasty." But you know what? The economy's rough. You can forgive her—even thank her—for leasing it out to Tinashe, who didn't take on stewardship of the word lightly.Tinashe's "Nasty" is both an impeccable Janet tribute—minimal, casual and freaky in all the right places—and a marker of what you can achieve if you tell the major label pop ecosystem to do one and chart your own path instead. It's the kind of song that seems forgettable at first listen and totally indispensable by your third, in part because it's so confident. Unlike so much pop this year, "Nasty" is so unbothered about proving itself to you that it's easy to dismiss at first glance, even as its rubbery bassline and off-kilter vocal samples build and build. Dismiss it at your peril. - Shaad D'Souza

### **Carré** - Fawn (SPE:C)
> Los Angeles bass enthusiast Carré elevated her skills in the studio this year. Following stellar releases on Beatrice M.'s Bait and Fast at Work, Air Sign EP was the standout. Sandwiched between a pair of heavier bangers, its comparatively low-key B-side, "Fawn," is a masterful distillation of her signature technoid dubstep. Moving at a subtly brisker clip than traditional 140, the track's bass pulses, spiralling vocals and dubbed-out drums shift and cycle, evoking the earth-rattling march of a giant.After 80 seconds of moody table-setting, a playful series of plucks erupts seemingly from nowhere, skipping up and down in pitch. Then, as quickly as it arrived, this cute riff is gone, displaying Carré's deft control over arrangement. For anyone curious about dark and minimal dubstep's evolution over the past decade, this is the place to start. - Tom Gledhill

### **Kim Gordon** - BYE BYE (Matador)
> Kim Gordon landed the coldest industrial trap record of 2024, you say? Why not. Where earlier instances of the downtown icon fringing electronic music were speckled in hiss—see Ciccone Youth's insouciant Madonna flip "Into The Groovey" or far-out noise excursions with illbient pioneer DJ Olive—"BYE BYE" is incredibly forthright.It's loud, both in the offhand banality of Kim Gordon rapping a pre-trip checklist (turtleneck, milk thistle, vibrator), as well as the collision of synth stabs, abrasive guitars and a beat that knocks like a cinder block to the head. Gordon can evidently sell anything. And if you figure the former frontwoman of Sonic Youth has no business being on an RA end-of-year list, well, I can think of two words she might use to bid that sentiment adieu too. - Gabriel Szatan

### **Mk.gee** - Breakthespell (R&R)
> If we're being honest, part of Mk.gee's appeal is that you can't understand a word he's saying. Throughout his dazzling debut album, Two Star & the Dream Police, the New Jersey-born artist's warbled vocals are at points barely decipherable—prioritising atmosphere over precision, which cloaks his music in a quixotic, almost Jai Paul-ish mist.On "Breakthespell," his voice melts into the heavily delayed guitars and billowing synths he's become known for. Once you finally manage to decode lyrics, they only heighten the hazy ambience, as he anguishedly calls out: "I can't win / And I won't end." The agent of his heartbreak is unclear; although if the song title offers any hints, it might even be Mk.gee himself. "Breakthespell" may not provide clarity, but it doesn't matter—this is the sound of catharsis. - Bella Aquilina

### **Charisse C & DJ Kwamzy** - Morning Sun (Abantu)
> It was almost inevitable that Charisse C, one of the UK's leading ambassadors for amapiano, would eventually step out from behind the decks and into the vocal booth. "Morning Sun" is her bright take on the beloved genre, buoyed by airy vocals that create a sense of spiritual peace. But those sparkling notes soon transform into a moody dance floor heater, channelling the irresistible drama of amapiano and 3-step's percussive patterns.With Kwamzy on the assist, the pair created a hybrid anthem that represents the vibrant sounds of contemporary South African dance music. As well as being an excellent entry into the canon, "Morning Sun" represents Charisse C's natural progression from DJ to fully rounded artist—and she makes it look effortless. - Jesse Bernard

### **Mica Levi** - slob air (Hyperdub)
> You never know what to expect from South London composer Mica Levi. Their last solo record, 2021's Blue Alibi, was a spiky, lo-fi grunge affair, while their score for Jonathan Glazer’s 2023 chilling film The Zone of Interest unleashed nightmares through experimental found sound.This summer, Levi once again opted for unpredictability with their Hyperdub debut, the 12-minute dream pop epic hypnotically circles around a loop of undulating synths, a rumbling bass hum and an assertive, locked-in beat. Occasionally, the transcendental melody is interrupted by a slight key change or the growing swell of indecipherable voices, but it's never enough to unseat the song's steady, meditative pace. "slob air" is like watching the sun rise on the top deck of the bus after a bleary night out—life-affirming. - Steph Philips

### **Thoughtforms** - Tubes (Thoughtforms)
> Uruguayan artist Fernando Zapico, AKA Z@P, has been steadily drip-feeding low-slung, acid tech house into the catalogues of niche labels for years. Now, his endeavours have culminated on Red, a statement of intent on own imprint. The EP's sharpest cut, "Tubes," features a classic proggy synth line that syphons off inspiration from techno, electro and wave, intertwining pulsing synths with metallic rhythms that pitter-patter across the four-four grid.While the rest of the EP nods towards some of the nostalgic signifiers defining today's zeitgeist—consider the mesmeric bounce of Kalahari Oyster Cult's output—"Tubes"' insatiable groove is the real winner. It's easy to imagine it ripping at the height of a raucous party, the crowd swaying to its heaving beat. - Chloe Lula

### **FKA twigs** - Eusexua (Young)
> In 2024, pop stars shaped culture not only through their art, but by outright defining social mores and public behaviour. Tinashe's "Nasty" allowed an anxiety-ridden generation having less casual sex to try on a slutty persona and Charli xcx's carefree BRAT paved a green road from the club to the Vice President's office.As the sun began to set on late summer, avant-pop visionary FKA twigs also chimed in with the sultry mystique of "Eusexua," the title track from her forthcoming album. While muted techno kicks thump in the distance, the song immediately introduces us not only to a feeling (which twigs describes as "the pinnacle of human experience"), but also an entire cinematic universe full of alien tattoos, silver statement jewellery, seven-inch Pleasers and sheer lingerie. twigs has always sung around the dance floor's periphery, but on "Eusexua," she's never sounded so sure of her place in the heart of the club. - Kiana Mickles

### **RHR & Logan_OLM** - Diagonal (Dub Mix) (Nice & Deadly)
> It's almost too easy to make a club incinerator with Logan_olm on the mic. The London MC has proven time and again that his fierce flows can dominate any beat. In 2024, he met his match in São Paulo funk export RHR, who spent years observing the UK scene from almost 6,000 miles away, fusing his learnings with Brazil's diasporic rhythms. So when he finally got in the ring with Logan, what was the result?The pair's rowdy team-up, "Diagonal (Dub Mix)," vaults straight out the blocks with disorientating sample chops and a chest-caving rumble, laying the perfect foundation for the MC's righteous assertions of his own ability to storm onto any track and make himself heard. Stomping bass that slips off its axis; flecks of flanged synth; percussion that reaches for tamborzão—it's a whirlwind of energy. "Diagonal (Dub Mix)" is the sound of São Paulo and London colliding spectacularly. - Nathan Evans

### **Joy Orbison** - flight fm (Hinge Finger)
> There's always one: doggedly ubiquitous, memed halfway to oblivion, the international overplayers' anthem. Our answer came in record time this year, after "flight fm" landed on January 17th and confirmed that Overmono's Dobermanns would be treated to 12 months of much needed R&R. Dance floors haven't exactly been light on wallopers cribbing their sub action from darkside jungle and speed garage lately, so to understand why "flight fm" went supernova, it's worth paying attention to what the song doesn't do."flight fm" is no-nonsense enough to make the track it might be modelled on, Si Begg's "Revolution No 1," sound positively cluttered. A dainty pre-tremor, some skippy drums and that enormous, grungy bassline—done. Incredibly effective. Vast pockets of negative space compelled others to fill in the blanks, which is why everyone from ropey TikTok remixers to Future and even The Chainsmokers (yes, seriously) mobbed in. What Joy O understands more than most is that a killer hook only represents half the battle. You still need the nous to clear everything else out the way and let it roll. - Gabriel Szatan

### **Snakeskin** - Waiting (Mais Um)
> Snakeskin's second album, They Kept Out Photographs, reflects on a tumultuous year in Lebanon, fuelled by a sense of anger, melancholy and defiance. Its pièce de résistance is the ominous and introspective "Waiting," which features one half of the duo, Julia Sabra, reciting an excerpt from Lebanese poet Etel Adnan's To Be in a Time of War. The words, profoundly poignant on their own, transform simple ongoings of daily life into acts of resistance during wartime.Paired with strong drums, the track opens with an eerie beat reminiscent of a church bell or a loud clock tolling the arrival of doomsday. The combination of Sabra's gradually distorting voice, the increasingly aggressive rhythm and almost mundane lyrics is deeply hypnotic, immersing us in Snakeskin's alternate reality. Yet, like a silver lining amid the heaviness, chimes add a subtle brightness, hinting at the resilience that quietly endures beneath the agony of living through destruction. - Tamara Saade

### **Objekt** - Ganzfeld (Djrum Remix) (Kapsela)
> Djrum vs. Objekt? The nerds were salivating. Djrum vs. Objekt on "Ganzfeld"? Tongues were practically on the floor. The ten-minute odyssey gets the gong for the year's glitchiest anthem, shapeshifting its way through tender piano, Syro-style turbulence and half-time freakouts with an exhilarating level of detail and unpredictability."Giving something a completely new context is, in some ways, the name of the game," Djrum recently told RA. He was talking about DJing, but you can tell he applied the same philosophy to this remix, transforming Objekt's much loved electro classic into a swarm of breakbeats and squiggly left turns. Few could have nailed it so hard. - Carlos Hawthorn

### **James K** - Blinkmoth (July Mix) (AD 93)
> This year, no artist has made downtempo more appealing than New York producer James K, whose breathy, lilting vocals have floated across some of 2024's best music. It makes sense that amid sustained geo-political violence and economic turbulence, we'd again find solace in shoegaze—music that slows the anxious heart while holding a mirror to deep-rooted angst we prefer to leave unspoken."Blinkmoth (July Mix)" commanded repeat listens this year for an instantaneous pull that sucks you into the muted vortex of James K's romantic solitude. As she sings about the endless transference of love, a trip-hop beat glides and gallops, tactfully situating us in the '90s. But really, it's the heavenly vocals that we're here for. Her delivery glistens with the Elizabeth Fraser effect: carried foremost by feeling, the curvature of her indecipherable lyrics capture the fleeting moment in which euphoria sinks into quiet melancholy. Additions like this to the electronic shoegaze revival should give any non-believer proof of its enduring relevance. - Kiana Mickles

### **Nick León & Erika de Casier** - Bikini (TraTraTrax)
> A great pop song is like a charm: compact and entrancing, a daydream corked and uncorked at will. If it can't guarantee good fortune, it can at least transport a listener somewhere they feel lucky to be. And no song in 2024 made as great an escape as Nick León and Erika de Casier's "Bikini.""It leaks into the music somehow," León said earlier this month of growing up by the ocean. The Miami native describes his compositions as spaces to inhabit rather than stories; a personal stamp strong enough to transform any output he lends his hand to, be that ambient (Gloria) or perreo heaters (Rompediskoteka). De Casier wields similar scene-setting skills: she wrote one of 2023's stickiest earworms, New Jeans' "Super Shy," without ever sacrificing her signature delicate style presented to perfection on 2019 breakout album, Essentials.An anthem like "Bikini" was always on the cards for the pair: their last collaboration, the Dionysian "Ex-Girlfriend" with SHYGIRL, nailed the body-first composition of Nelly Furtado and Timbaland's best work. Harp-like keyboard notes pierce the clip of a bassline, plunging into deep dembow as elegantly as four-on-the-floor. Embracing de Casier's crystalline mezzo-soprano, "Bikini" pushes sound into pure sensation: sand between toes and lips on goose-pimpled skin. When she was a teenager, "going to the swimming pool was the worst thing I could imagine," she told Mixmag in 2021. A decade-plus later, "Bikini" comes alive in the shedding of those inhibitions: why hedge around the pool, when you could head straight for the sea?Despite "Bikini"'s deft movement between shifting rhythmic patterns, the track still manages to capture a profound sense of pause. Trying to make sense of the changing tides—"Lookin' out there / Tryin' to find a meaning"—de Casier only finds herself recentered "with the wind in my hair, just breathing in the air." It's these atmospheric tendencies that take "Bikini" from the track of September to the track of the year. Before León and de Casier, artists from Otis Redding to Kelela have gazed "out there," hoping to find some sort of solace in the meeting of water and sky. And in a year so rife with misery, there are plenty of reasons to be fearful for the future. But "Bikini" charts a different course—it's a three-minute appeal to just be. - Hattie Lindert

## [The Best Records of 2024](https://ra.co/features/4404)
Date: 2024-12-03T11:05:14.000Z

### **British Murder Boys** - Active Agents and House Boys (downwards)
> Surgeon and Regis have been creating industrial anthems as British Murder Boys for more than two decades. Individually, they're synonymous with taut, stripped back dance floor grooves that close a circle between musique concrète and steel-toed techno. But when they come together, their output is raw and unbridled, channelling the punk lineage of Coil, Suicide and Throbbing Gristle.Indeed, their debut LP, Active Agents and House Boys, is fundamentally live-sounding, its distorted kicks and walls of resonant feedback grinding like unoiled gears. Yet the music's embrace of funk and even melody — a new string to their bow—underlines the duo's conviction that serious music doesn't have to take itself so seriously. - Chloe Lula

### **Regal86** - Unearthed Vol.II*100 Trax* (self-released)
> 100 tunes. Let that sink in for a second. One hundred. The craziest thing? Unearthed Vol. II *100 Trax* isn't even a slog. In fact, these bitesize jams slide down like a fresh cocktail—all zinger, no filler.Regal86's exquisite drum work, crafty sampling and smoky sound palette coat the vast Bandcamp dump in a marked soulfulness. Even more impressive, he's no one-trick pony: the Monterrey producer is just as adept slinging out dubby ambient techno ("Deep Forest") and slamming hip-hop ("Quiero que sepan") as euphoric hardcore ("Fades") and the hardgroove ("Baby Phat Jacket") he built his name on. Honestly, it's all so good. All of it. - Carlos Hawthorn

### **Jlin** - Akoma (Planet Mu)
> The first thing Jlin fans will notice on her third album, Akoma, is that the producer and composer's idol, Philip Glass, has added his famous arpeggios. Avant-garde queen Björk and contemporary ensemble Kronos Quartet also impressively made the roster.These features hint at the direction Jlin, who has gone from inventive footwork producer to unruly experimental composer, has taken over the years. "Eye Am"'s jubilant hand drums find more common ground with traditional African drumming, whereas "Summon" creates tension with a torrent of piercing strings. Rest assured, though, one listen to the plinky keys and juddering rhythms on "Grannie's Cherry Pie" confirms that this is still music that will spring dancers and footworkers into action. - Kiana Mickles

### **Nourished By Time** - Catching Chickens EP (Nourished By Time)
> Nourished by Time makes double-take music. When you first hear Marcus Brown's hypnagogic R&B anthems, you almost can't believe someone is going that hard. His songs, which gesture towards the spiritual truths underpinning quotidian tasks, are imbued with a life-or-death urgency by his stentorian baritone alone.Following 2023's breakout Erotic Probiotic 2, Catching Chickens sees Brown stretching out stylistically, exploring shoegaze guitars ("Poison-Soaked"), funhouse synth solos ("Had Ya Called") and classic nightclub crooning ("Romance in Me"). But it's the massive opener, "Hell of a Ride," that keeps us coming back. With its airy chorus, galloping beat and infectious "goodbye baby, goodbye" refrain, you can envisage Brown speeding off into yet uncharted territory. - Matt McDermott

### **Nala Sinephro** - Endlessness (Warp)
> It can be tough for a rising artist to follow up a spectacular album. Nala Sinephro's sublime debut, Space 1.8, mesmerised listeners in 2021 for its soul-stirring marriage of ambient and spiritual jazz. Three years later, the London-based harpist and modular synthesist returned with a second LP that dives deeper into restorative sounds.As its title implies, Endlessness feels like an infinite moment in time, suspended by languorous synth arpeggios and hushed sax runs. While some jazz fans prefer the dynamism of its predecessor, the beauty of Endlessness lies in its quietude. Sit back and soak up its ambrosial chords. - Nyshka Chandran

### **Midland** - Fragments of Us (Graded)
> Midland's long-awaited debut album, Fragments of Us, is a moving document of queer heritage, from the peak of the AIDS crisis and institution of the UK's discriminatory Section 28 legislation to the utopian dreaming of artists like Stereogamus' Jonny Seymour and clubs like NYC Downlow.The record is a collection of moody and overcast downtempo songs, in which Midland's poignant yet glittering arpeggios and skittering drums commune with queer voices, past and present. But as much as it's an interrogation of the violence that has engulfed queer public life, Fragments of Us is also a celebration—just wait for those life-affirming strings on "Chapter 10." - Henry Ivry

### **Total Blue** - Total Blue (Music From Memory)
> What do you picture when you think of the Los Angeles skyline? Maybe it's a haze of hot air, twinkling lights at night or how the city seems to stretch as far as the eye can see. It's that topography and atmosphere that Angeleno trio Total Blue wanted to replicate on their debut LP.They succeeded with gusto: the record is a gentle, meandering excursion through expansive ambient textures, New Age jazz experimentations and lush vintage melodies that recall noirish film scenes where the protagonist drives through Beverly Hills, totally unburdened by the downward pressures of life. A stunning escape. - Katie Thomas

### **gum.mp3** - Black Life, Red Planet (Gum Studio)
> gum.mp3 is that all-too-rare artist making smart music you can still go stupid to. The Baltimore-based producer and eldiaNYC crew member's latest offering, Black Life, Red Planet, is a studied yet unfussy expedition through house and jungle, woven with threads of blues, funk and trap."Knowingness" shakes the dust from a swampy blues riff; on "Deimos," a red herring flamenco loop gives way to dembow that could be played via a didgeridoo. "Believe," co-produced with Detroit juke master swoozydolphin, might be the first ambient soundbath with a breakbeat. gum.mp3 creates a common home for radical creative traditions too often siloed—it's one of the most innovative projects of the year. - Hattie Lindert

### **Tim Reaper & Kloke** - In Full Effect (Hyperdub)
> It's hard to believe it took this long for Tim Reaper to release a full-length album. Same goes for agenda-setting label Hyperdub, which, before In Full Effect, had never released a jungle LP. Luckily, Reaper and Naarm (Melbourne) producer Kloke linked up to do the honours, whisking different flavours of early '90s breakbeat into something that transcends the all-too-comfortable pastiche of revivalism.They masterfully reimagine what jungle's trajectory would've looked like had it gone on uninterrupted from its ragga era, with propulsive drum programming and emotional atmospherics serving as the project's anchor. Evocative and trance-inducing, In Full Effect has only solidified jungle's enduring versatility. - Emeka Okonkwo

### **Tyla** - Tyla (FAX/Epic)
> It all started with "Water." In 2023, South African pop powerhouse Tyla's refreshing R&B single launched her into global stardom—and even kicked off a millions-strong TikTok dance craze. This year's self-titled debut album builds on that momentum with a carefully balanced work that's as exciting as it is soulful, as assured as it is vulnerable.Infused with pop, Afrobeats and polished amapiano log drums, the LP is a potent reflection of the various global musical cultures that raised Tyla. Her thoughts on her own identity may have sparked social media discourse, but she stood firm in her truth, dog-walking doubters all the way to the GRAMMYs. - Shiba Melissa Mazaza

### **Various Artists** - Sky Is The Limit (Love on the Rocks)
> Love On The Rocks' catalogue oozes fun and whimsy. On this ten-year compilation, PARAMIDA gathered label regulars (Massimiliano Pagliara, Fantastic Man) and newbies (Sweely, E-Talking) to curate a record capturing the label's exuberant palette of colour and feeling—think trancey synths, progressive grooves, wriggling 303s, dreamy melodies and pumping house rhythms.The frivolity is loudest in the bounce of Alex Kassian & Running Hot's closer "The Love Theme," which gleefully samples Haddaway's 1993 chart-topper "What Is Love." Toasting to a decade via a gleaming eight tracks is a confident missive. Some may say the compilation leans towards "guilty pleasure." To that, we say: there's no such thing—it's just pleasure. - Katie Thomas

### **Skee Mask** - ISS010 (Ilian Tape)
> ISS010 strikes a chord with both factions of Skee Mask's fan base: the production nerds and the DJ set devotees. For the heads, it delivers his signature package of intricately layered sound design, dense percussion, and a wash of echo and reverb. But this time, the DJ devotees get their due as well. ISS010 marks a shift from Skee Mask’s breakbeat explorations to a more dance floor-focused sound, reflecting the heavily house and techno-infused energy of his current DJ sets. The seven-tracker blends syncopated rhythms with gorgeous melodies, weaving flashes of dubstep and ambient textures into rave-ready form. Grime-indebted beats on tracks like “The Bills” could as readily host an MC as send a Detroit loft party into overdrive, while “Double Standard” combines shimmering synths with propulsive drums, making it well suited for introspective home listening or peak-time club play. In a major year for Skee Mask, ISS010 was a record that engaged both body and soul. - Fahad Akinsanya

### **CCL & Ciel** - Tilda's Goat Stare (NAFF)
> CCL and Ciel are a natural fit. Not only because of the DJ-producer pair's enduring friendship, but their shared affinity for journeying through the psychedelic end of the rave spectrum, from proggy doof bangers to swampy downtempo.The unruly title track on their powerful joint EP lights the path to a portal filled with bass pressure and dialogue sampled from Tilda Swinton's 2002 film Teknolust (with an acid-spiked Priori remix to boot). "Goblin Mode" burrows into a subterranean network of synth gurgles and menacing hoover, while "Spiral Drive" sounds like a cyborg reaching for a higher state of consciousness. Who else could melt a feminist sci-fi film into chemistry-altering club trax? - April Clare Welsh

### **Various Artists** - Letters to a Future Palestine (Umay)
> The first compilation on Nene H's UMAY label is a proud display of musical and political unity. Featuring an array of artists and allies from across the Palestinian and SWANA diaspora—ranging from Muskila and KETTALYNNE to Estoc and rRoxymore—Letters to a Future Palestine's 19 tracks are a collective call for solidarity.Traditional drum loops reworked for the rave ("Arish") and powerful Arabic vocal passages ("TARWIDA") build on the sense of ritual and communion, while disjointed breaks accompany eerie grime verses ("Ghrab Ilbain"), all bound by a palpable spirit of defiance. With proceeds going to Gaza's community kitchens, this moving collection of tracks transmits hope for Palestinian freedom. - Nyshka Chandran

### **Verraco** - Breathe, Godspeed (Timedance)
> On Breathe, Godspeed, Verraco is in full-throttle mode. The Colombian producer's subversive attitude takes flight via a bricolage of techno, dembow, IDM and glitch, bodying listeners with its sheer weight. Intensity levels escalate to a peak with a clever emphasis on rave fundamentals rather than shock value: there are nasty basslines, tribal influences, elements of rowdy post-dubstep and distorted vocal samples.Tracks are thunderous and jaw-dropping but strategically calibrated, transforming the cadence of Latin rhythms into a throbbing mass of futuristic sound design. Breathe, Godspeed is a radical snapshot of Verraco's music-making philosophy—it disorients, stimulates and, best of all, knows exactly what it wants to say. - Nyshka Chandran

### **Mabe Fratti** - Sentir Que No Sabes (Unheard of Hope)
> "At the moment, I'm pro-confusion. Or maybe not," wrote Guatemalan composer Mabe Fratti in the liner notes of her fourth LP, Sentir Que No Sabes, which means "to feel that I don't know" in Spanish. The first clue that demonstrates the strength of her latest work is opener, "Kravitz," with its funky cello bassline, dark atmospherics and strolling-pace rhythm. It's a fitting introduction to the musician's most accessible album yet, which largely forgoes the murky timbres and synth abstraction of her earlier works.Instead, tracks such as "Oídos," where Fratti's sweet soprano springs above whining trumpet, have spawned comparisons to the jazzy angst of singer-songwriters like Fiona Apple. Or take "Descubrimos un suspiro," where her voice is raw and up close as strings rustle against warm horns. On Sentir Que No Sabes, Fratti takes the threads of her denser projects and weaves it into a richly textured, utterly enthralling tapestry. - Kiana Mickles

### **Nídia & Valentina** - Estradas (Latency)
> Nídia and Valentina Magaletti may be from different musical backgrounds, but one thing they have in common is a shared disregard for convention. Nídia is something of an outlier within the Príncipe universe, her singular brand of kuduro and batida positioned slightly outside of the label's core sound. As for Magaletti, the experimental percussionist appears to be driven by a burning desire to constantly break new rhythmic ground, with each of her collaborative projects more ambitious than the last.It's no surprise, then, that their debut joint project, Estradas, sounded like little else this year. The nine-track LP begins as a tense to and fro between two artists feeling each other out, but the moments in which they find a shared musical language are dizzying. It's both a testament to the transcendental powers of rhythm and the thrilling possibilities of improvised collaboration. - Michael Lawson

### **Syclops** - Black Eye (Bubble Tease Comms)
> "Fried Ice Cream Is a Reality." Maurice Fulton's Twitter bio offers a glimpse into a typically press-shy artist's delight for oddball concepts. The Baltimore DJ and producer's vast discography connects the dots between disco, jazz, house and experimental electronics, from BOOF and Eddie & The Eggs to unexpected collaborations with Crystal Waters and Roísin Murphy.His singular sense for fusing the weird and the funky has perhaps never been more apparent than on Syclops' fourth album, Black Eye. The trio—Fulton, percussionist Mim Suleiman and guitarist Hanna Sarkari—delivers yet another kaleidoscopic album bursting at the seams with ideas: tracks like "Pink Sarah NYC Is Back" invoke future jazz and bleep techno, while "Karo Is Going Swimming" sounds like dub techno chucked through a cosmic blender. It's frankly bananas, and our dance floors are all the better for it. - Bella Aquilina

### **gyrofield** - These Heavens (XL Recordings)
> When getting arms around this riot of hyper-technical programming, overlapping rivulets of sound and intricate fidelity, it's worth stating things plainly: These Heavens is one of the most satisfying EPs in quite some time.Drum & bass virtuoso gyrofield (AKA Kiana Li) has been quietly prolific in recent years, popping up everywhere from Critical to Eastern Margins. Yet it was her XL debut where she truly shot for the moon with a record informed by stargazing and Stephen Hawking as much as Hideo Kojima and Noisia. Li practically undergoes a full villain arc in 23 minutes, staging a shift from tones so crystalline you'd be forgiven for thinking they were beamed direct from the Pillars of Creation, to mottled drumfunk hissing and heaving under the weight of menace. These Heavens is explosive, but more than that, it's pure cosmology in motion. - Gabriel Szatan

### **DJ Anderson do Paraíso** - Queridão (Nyege Nyege Tapes)
> DJ Anderson do Paraíso knows how to twist baile funk's frenetic energy into haunted minimalism. The Belo Horizonte native's productions merge sparse electronic elements inspired by drill and trap with sluggish violins, pianos, flutes and timpani—all of which fill the air with a mysterious sensuality and ominous aura. Queridão, which translates to "beloved" from Portuguese, is a collection of tracks that has taken the producer from SoundCloud cult favourite to living legend in the rising funk mineiro scene of Belo Horizonte.The mountainous, landlocked city is widely celebrated for its slower and more melodic take on funk, but what sets Anderson apart is his commitment to downright eerie experimentalism, stripping down the sound's full-bodied elements to forge epic and radical restraint. It's really no wonder that Queridão stands out as some of the most enticingly abstract dance music of the year. - GG Albuquerque

### **Polygonia** - Da Nao Tian Gong (Midgar)
> Da Nao Tian Gong is Polygonia's most watched childhood film. Translating to "Havoc in Heaven," the narrative links heaven to nature—from the peaches of immortality in the Heavenly Garden to Fruit Mountain. The Chinese-German artist has consistently sought out lessons from our environment, recently telling Resident Advisor: "People should collaborate together in peace to save our planet."In 2024, Earth is increasingly heating up. Cities—and people—have been set alight. On Da Nao Tian Gong, Polygonia makes sense of this destruction through an effervescent mix of ambient, techno and downtempo, using the synthetic to recreate the organic, from a synth pad dawn chorus to the rhythmic hissing of water. Nestled at the heart of this sublime EP lies the simple yet powerful message of protecting our world. The peaches, the seeds, the roots. In a year of mass displacement, what could be more pertinent than that? - Vivian Yeung

### **Astrid Sonne** - Great Doubt (Escho)
> Great Doubt is Astrid Sonne's first album as a singer-songwriter, but she's been using her voice for much longer. The Danish artist has spoken about her time spent in church choirs, acknowledging its role in shaping her vocals: "I definitely wouldn't be singing as loud as I do." On Great Doubt, Sonne is definitely loud, producing immense emotional volume out of sparse arrangements."Do you wanna" arrives with a straight but heavy drum beat as Sonne confesses, "Do you wanna have a baby? / I really don't know." This unnervingly direct existentialism runs through the entire album, whether in the slow, booming 808s on "Everything is unreal" or the simple pizzicato viola on "Almost." Sonne doesn't shy away from bold, unembellished statements, only augmenting the sense of intimacy (as on the plaintive, Ben Vince-assisted "Say you love me"). In daring to confront her deepest fears head-on, Sonne has made the year's most striking pop album. - Bella Aquilina

### **Charli xcx** - BRAT (Atlantic)
> For a decade, Charli xcx thrashed between two seemingly contradictory stations: pop sweetheart and cult icon. She lacquered finely tuned singles in industry-standard polish, then loaded brilliant, labyrinthine albums with dense lines about her deepest fears. With BRAT, she swung to please her niche—and ended up painting the summer radioactive green. Her most momentous album to date is a rare animal: a galvanising pop record all wound up for the club on one hand, a glistening smorgasbord of spilled guts on the other.By turning her insecurities inside out on songs like "Sympathy is a knife" and "Girl, so confusing," then counterweighting those cerebations with the whole-body release of "Von dutch" and "Club classics," Charli alchemised a new vision of her own success. She's long picked over the question of what it means to make it. BRAT homes in on something of an answer: there's no "it" to make. Sell all the records you want, or don't—you have to come home to yourself either way. Might as well crank the bass and dance through it. - Sasha Geffen

### **De Schuurman** - Bubbling Forever (Nyege Nyege Tapes)
> Slamming body music from a true master who transmits the vivacity and nerve of Caribbean club culture: that's Bubbling Forever. On his second official collection of bubbling—a sped-up mutation of dancehall—Dutch-Surinamese producer De Schuurman builds on the genre's Afro-diasporic legacy with a clutch of tracks designed to whip up hysteria in the rave."Benniale Dakar" starts with the ominous drama of an early Pop Smoke trap tune then launches into a rattling speed dembow. As smoky pads permeate the air, the beat decelerates into half-time—only a quick moment to gather your waist before the wine-inducing rhythms of "Bubbling Meets Kaseko," which fuse bubbling's restless kicks with traditional Surinamese skratji percussion. On "Stylez two," mischievous samples of Lil Jon's infamous "OK!" and KRS-One's "Sound of da Police" can jolt even the stiffest hips into work. When "Scratchin"'s pointillist synths plink around vocal samples of "I'm just scratchin' the surface," you get the sense it's both a call to action and warning shot: Schuurman is here to stay. - Rachel Grace Almeida

### **Loidis** - One Day (Incienso)
> Not waving, or drowning, but drifting. That's how 2024 felt for many of us: a serotonin crash made all the more raw by an increasingly cruel world. After years of clubland electrifying the masses with the shock of the new, we chose to lean the other way, prioritising cosy records that made you thankful for what you already have (a craving that, in alternative circles, drew people to the spectral-jukebox transmissions of Cindy Lee like moth to flame). Into this climate landed a masterclass in softer vibrations from Brian Leeds, who, as Huerco S. and Pendant, has already proved himself a master of suspended animation several times over. One Day both encapsulated the mood and cut through it like a beacon.Does it augur poorly for a culture built on progression to take a step back and recalibrate? Well, the past was priced in; Loidis is the ancient name for Leeds, after all. And though One Day was built around slippery micro rhythms and delayed dub stabs, Leeds hardly soapboxed for a return to subtlety. The strongest promo was essentially happenstance, after he termed the project "dub mnml emo tech" to wriggle out of anything too formal, but wound up perfectly articulating its playful vibe.Just as For Those Of You…'s truncated loops were a creative sleight-of-hand, One Day pulls off a sly trick throughout. Leeds mimics the lossy compression and audio degradation favoured by the clicks 'n cuts set, only this time using stem separation software and creative resampling that falls closer, he told us, to hypermodern genres. In doing so, he created a shapeshifting palette: all muzzled kicks, panned basslines bobbing through hyaline textures and indulgent codas tacked onto nine- or ten-minute tunes ("Why Do," "Love's Linneaments," "Sugar Snot") that you could have sworn flashed by in four. It scans as wrong at first blush, so you're compelled to run it back a dozen times—by which point, naturally, it sounds exceptional.One Day doesn't just revitalise styles that faded from favour; it glows with the patience of Shinchi Atobe and DJ Sprinkles, the frolic of Isolée and Dinky, the 3 AM soul-searching of Claro Intelecto and Paul St. Hilaire. Most obviously, the spirit of Alcachofa and Vocalcity feel hardcoded into its DNA. These are records that have meant a lot to people over the years, made by artists who have stood the test of time. I'd be lying if I didn't think Leeds is in that conversation now.When it arrived, One Day might have seemed too discrete to break out, but months of compulsive listening have upended that. If we're resting at a waystation en route to a destination as-yet-unclear, there was no more generous or agreeable companion. So while there aren't many conclusions to be drawn from the discomforting haze of 2024, this much is true: the album that felt primed to take a slow stroll to classic status has raced way ahead of schedule. It's already there. - Gabriel Szatan

## [The Best Albums of 2023](https://ra.co/features/4293)
Date: 2023-12-14T14:00:39.000Z

### Kelela - Raven (Warp Records)
> Warp RecordsKelela - Raven At the shows for her new album, Kelela stood alone onstage. This was a deliberate choice, she explained, to have everything stripped back so audiences could see her—and hear her—for all she was. But up there, the blue lights around her dimmed, it was clear that her solitary figure also reflected her more bitter-than-sweet struggles against what she described as "male stoicism." This remark came from the revelations she had while reading The Will to Change, an investigation of men, masculinity and love by the radical Black feminist scholar bell hooks. Her epiphany was painstakingly reflected in the dancehall derivation "On The Run": "You get around enough / Too busy actin' tough / Give me a softer side / I won't wait all night." Patriarchal culture doesn't only hurt women, Kelela discovered—it also restricts the way men are able to explore intimacy and achieve wholeness for themselves. I saw Kelela perform in Berlin. 13 of Raven's 15 tracks were produced there, and it shows. There's a sorrow and solemnity woven into the city's monochromatic corners that echo through Raven, like a pebble rattling in an empty aluminium can. Even the title track is underpinned by a spacious yearning, as if on the brink of a breaking point—"Took all my labour / Don't tell me that I'm strong," she sings, before gradually trotting into a heaving 4/4 beat, a subtle nod to clubbing as escapism. By the album's conclusion, "Far Away," Kelela finds her deliverance in the form of honeyed ad-libs undulating over sounds of crashing waves, as if signalling that with enough time and perspective, all pain can be alchemised into pure spirit. -Whitney Wei

### Caroline Polachek - Desire I Want To Turn Into You (Perpetual Novice)
> Perpetual NoviceCaroline Polachek - Desire I Want To Turn Into You Diving headfirst into the delusion and madness that accompanies the all-consuming feeling of romantic and sexual passion, this unapologetically raw album leaves no stone unturned in its portrayal of emotional intensity. Through visceral lyrics that underline the idea of desire as a truly physical sensation, the ex-Chairlift vocalist sings of self-indulgent surrender to a lover without the slightest care of appearing desperate or needy. But it's the production—from Polachek and Danny L. Harle—that truly makes this a multifaceted pop record: feathery drum & bass, flamenco, dreamy rock and bassy R&B bops add to the physicality of Polachek's feelings, pushing her theatrical vocals outside of the shielded realm of inner thoughts and into the material world. -Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### James Holden - Imagine This Is A High Dimensional Space Of All Possibilities (Border Community)
> Border CommunityJames Holden - Imagine This Is A High Dimensional Space Of All Possibilities James Holden's music has always been otherworldly. Raised on pirate radio, folktronica, free jazz and everything in between, he conjures up mythical fairy tales where flickers of dance music past meander into pastoral soundscapes. This all culminated with Imagine This Is A High Dimensional Space Of All Possibilities, which marks a welcome return to the club for Holden—or his version of it, anyway. Recognisable dance music tropes (hints of dub techno, echoes of house, microdoses of rave) nestle into the rich and complex instrumentation that gives all of Holden's music its distinctive flair. If Jon Hassell had been born four decades later and became hooked on acid house, this is the album he would've wanted to write. -Henry Ivry Listen: Bandcamp

### Tirzah - trip9love...? (Domino)
> DominoTirzah - trip9love...? Over the past decade, childhood friends Tirzah Maston and Mica Levi have become a quietly formidable power duo (in leftfield music circles, at least). On their latest LP of heart-tugging R&B, Levi's tough 808s and trilling piano sketches hold a steady, unrelenting pace while Tirzah pours her heart into 11 rough-and-ready love songs. All the familiar hallmarks of Tirzah are there—understated vocals and a sound rooted in "disarming simplicity"—but here everything is notched up to a new, more physical intensity. Each track packs a smouldering punch and Levi's distorted piano melodies on tracks like "F22" and "Promises" have Grand Cru earworm qualities. The album turns Tirzah and Levi's often ramshackle songs into a steamrolling train that tugs at the heartstrings all the harder, while still holding onto the lightweight feel that makes all of the project's music so enchanting. -Conor McTernan Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Regal86 - La Onda (Self-released)
> Self-releasedRegal86 - La Onda If there was one trend in techno to note this year—aside from "fast"—it was hardgroove, a taut and loopy style originally pioneered in the '90s and making one hell of a comeback on dance floors across the Americas and Europe in 2023. Regal86, a buzzy producer from Monterrey makes all kinds of music, but he's particularly good at hardgroove. His album La Onda landed at the perfect time to take the revival to the next level. With breathless sequencing and expert programming, this is hard, fast dance music that doesn't bludgeon you over the head, but instead invites you to dance and get lost in its intricacies. And with trip-hop breaks and clever interludes, La Onda works as an album through and through, recalling some '90s techno greats with real finesse. -Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Overmono - Good Lies (XL Recordings)
> XL RecordingsOvermono - Good Lies Going from throwing makeshift parties deep in the woods to sold-out global tours, Overmono's ascent is long overdue. After a decade of passionate grinding in the underground, their debut album, Good Lies, makes a well-earned victory lap. Boundless euphoria is the goal and '90s rave and Burial-adjacent techno are the means—including radio-ready vocal chops from the likes of Tirzah, Slowthai and CASISDEAD. Having penned a vibrant love letter to both the past and present of UK dance music, the two brothers from rural Wales establish themselves as authors of its future. -Emeka Okonkwo Listen: Bandcamp

### James Blake - Playing Robots Into Heaven (Columbia)
> ColumbiaJames Blake - Playing Robots Into Heaven Don't call it a comeback… but James Blake's latest album kind of feels like a comeback. He's spent years perfecting an electronic singer-songwriter style that has seen him working with everyone from Kendrick Lamar to Frank Ocean. On Playing Robots Into Heaven, he dives head first into club music and delivers some of his canniest fusions yet. The melodrama and introspection is still there, but on tracks like the thrilling "Loading" or the surging house of "Fall Back," his words—and dextrous vocal chopping—gains a whole new power, especially when sandwiched between woozy ballads like "Fire The Editor." In other words, it's the best of both worlds. -Andrew Ryce Apple Music / Spotify

### Mr. G - Pearls Don't Lay On The Shore (Childhood)
> ChildhoodMr. G - Pearls Don't Lay On The Shore According to Mr. G, Pearls Don't Lay On The Shore is what happens when he makes music from the soul. Over 14 tracks, the funky tech house he built his name on makes room for plaintive New Age delights and darkly tinted downtempo. It's a turbulent, subaquatic voyage that reaches even murkier depths than 2021's The Forced Force Is Not The True Force. Where the sonar-guided ominousness and broad sawtooth basslines on tracks like "No Safe Zones" evoke the ocean floor, the searching keys and trance-inducing hand drums on tracks like "For Those Who Have Lost" still reach for the cosmos. A riveting ode to his mother Sylvia, Pearls Don't Lay On The Shore is Mr G. at his most soul searching and experimental. -Emeka Okonkwo Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### DJ Gigola - Fluid Meditations (Live From Earth)
> Live From EarthDJ Gigola - Fluid Meditations Aside from being a phenomenal debut album, Fluid Meditations is compelling because it embodies the enduring influence of wellness culture on dance music. The album is a tropical, at times ghostly take on modern New Age electronic music, with vocal techniques that recall Voice Actor's sibilant whispers and the guided meditation of DJ Python's memorable 2020 cut "ADMSDP." The album picks up in its second half, the meditation laid underneath hoover synths and spritely trance, making it a record that travels well from day into night. -Kiana Mickles Listen: Bandcamp

### Maara - The Ancient Truth (Step Ball Chain)
> Step Ball ChainMaara - The Ancient Truth Maara has a preternatural sense for interstellar atmospheres that are also suited to intimate home listening. Her debut album yawns to life with loose breakbeats over a lattice of whispery vocals, and eventually spins out into another realm of glimmering downtempo music. A special kind of self-assured ease in drifting into the unknown exists here. The Ancient Truth feels like a period of focused introspection, full of lush pads and pensive basslines, that reveals an inner world even more vast and mystical than how it first seems (just after the beat drops on the title track, a "wake up, wake up" chirps in the distance). All it takes is a wide-eyed sense of wonder to appreciate Dunbar's gentle yet far-flung exploration. -Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp

### Surgeon - Crash Recoil (Tresor)
> TresorSurgeon - Crash Recoil On Crash Recoil, Surgeon's first album in five years, he said he tried to bring his live improvisational sets to the studio for the first time, "in the same way that bands tour songs before going into the studio to record an album." The Detroit-indebted swing of earlier albums is subdued to a simmering pulse, and Surgeon's longtime influences—experimental rock bands Coil and Faust—take centre stage. Spectral pads elongate over crunchy drums. Abrasive melodies appear and fade into the ether. Songs travel with the meandering, liberated structure of music built through feeling instead of dance floor mania, unlocking a new level of depth and nuance in one of the most legendary catalogues in techno. -Kiana Mickles Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Wata Igarashi - Agartha (Kompakt)
> KompaktWata Igarashi - Agartha Techno trends come and go, but Wata Igarashi will never go out of style. Cerebral, psychedelic, Rome school—whatever adjective you choose to describe the Japanese producer's music, so long as clubs are willing to stay open for more than 12 hours at a time, there'll always be DJs digging for Igarashi's style of lean, introverted techno. This makes his debut album, Agartha, such a curveball. The LP fuses Berlin school Krautrock and fourth world ambient with the odd bit of Detroit electro and techno, both unexpected and unbelievably impressive. Igarashi has always been more than "just" a techno producer, but Agartha solidifies his reputation as a true electronic music visionary. -Henry Ivry Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Yves Tumor - Praise a Lord Who Chews But Does Not Consume (Warp Records)
> Warp RecordsYves Tumor - Praise a Lord Who Chews But Does Not Consume It's hard to believe Yves Tumor's Praise A Lord Who Chews But Which Does Not Consume; (Or Simply, Hot Between Worlds) came out in March—it already feels like one of those timeless cult albums fans know inside-out. In recent years, the US artist has swirled around the smokey, delay-drenched periphery of '90s alt rock. Here, they jump right in, heels first, to riff on alt-rock greats like Jimi Hendrix ("Heaven Surround Us…"), The Strokes ("Operator") and even prime-era Bloc Party ("In Spite of War"), with epic guitar leads and explosive drum patterns as the rushing, technicolour backdrop to Tumor's angsty lyricism. -Sophie McNulty Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Nondi_ - Flood City Trax (Planet Mu)
> Planet MuNondi_ - Flood City Trax Johnstown, Pennsylvania, suffered devastating floods in 1889, 1936 and 1977. What was once a city with a thriving steel mill and coal industry was left in tatters alongside a draining population. According to local producer Nondi_, those who were left behind—like herself—now live in limbo, floating between boredom and a constant fear of when the next flood will strike. On her ambient juke LP Flood City Trax, cutesy, cotton-cloud FX meet frenetic footwork percussion to convey a conflicting and distant depiction of a place that's been left for dead by the rest of the world, yet stubbornly lives on. -Joseph Francis Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Paul St. Hilaire - Tikiman Vol.1 (Kynant Records)
> Kynant RecordsPaul St. Hilaire - Tikiman Vol.1 It's been 17 years since his last album, but Paul St. Hilaire remains dub techno incarnate. The OG producer and Basic Channel collaborator resurfaced this March with nine exquisite tracks that show off his mastery of subtle, politically charged grooves. Touching on downtempo, minimal techno, roots reggae and dancehall, Tikiman Vol.1 runs the gamut genre-wise while delivering concise commentary on displacement, education and memory. Fuzzy dub tones on "Keep Safe" and "The Weather Man" give way to chuggier cuts like "In Door," with St. Hilaire's mesmeric vocals and streamlined basslines acting as key transition tools throughout. Still instantly recognisable, the dub techno MC has a way of making dreamy, '90s-style atmospheres feel fresh with carefully leftfield touches. -Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp

### Laurel Halo - Atlas (Awe)
> AweLaurel Halo - Atlas Laurel Halo never loved playing the piano, but she returned to it just before the pandemic. And then she was kind of stuck with it, until it became her defining instrument of the decade so far. On Atlas, her first so-called ambient album, she takes her piano and the sounds of collaborators on strings and explodes it into sonic dust. Those particles are rearranged into gentle compositions that inhale and exhale like a living respiratory system, with melodies that appear like clouds on the horizon before rolling away and letting the music clear up again. Atlas takes the fearless compositional framework of past albums and her ear for slight-but-dazzling melodies and presents them in a new, almost neoclassical way. It's another excellent entry in one of dance music's most wonderfully unpredictable discographies. -Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### DJ Danifox - Ansiedade (Príncipe)
> PríncipeDJ Danifox - Ansiedade Traditionally, batida is a sound characterised by a lively interplay of emotions and energies: roiling drums, racing tempos and rousing vocals. Lisbon label Príncipe has long documented the genre's many faces, from electro bangers to housey grooves, and this stunning offering from one of its core members reveals a foggier take. The slow-burning LP unravels like a gentle love letter, pairing intuitive, staccato drums with conversational vocals and lush instrumentation (guitar and woodwinds). There are hints of jazz, trap and dub techno—perhaps a reference to batida's own cross-pollination from various Angolan and Portuguese styles—and a thread of tenderness and toughness. Danifox's lilting melodies wrap batida's bounce into a dulcet, romantic daze. -Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### a.s.o. - a.s.o. (Low Lying Records)
> Low Lying Recordsa.s.o. - a.s.o. Lewie Day and Alia Seror-O'Neill's debut self-titled LP as a.s.o is one of those albums that anyone with a longing for nostalgia could fall in love with—fans of Mazzy Star, Warp Records devotees, trip-hop lovers. Part of the reason why is because the album's palette sounds eerily familiar, like every phenomenal downtempo album released before the turn of the millennium blended into one. But it's not pastiche: the lyrics feel bitingly modern and the production is taken to outer space in ways their predecessors didn't yet have the language for. And to top it off, Seror-O'Neill's frigid, sultry voice reverberates through it all gracefully. -Kiana Mickles Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Sofia Kourtesis - Madres (Ninja Tune)
> Ninja TuneSofia Kourtesis - Madres There's a track on Madres, the debut album from Berlin-based artist Sofia Kourtesis, named after the neurosurgeon who saved her mother's life. Kourtesis's music has always been connected to familial relationships—2021's Fresia Magalena EP was named after Fresia (her mother) and Magdalena (the district in Lima where she's from) while reflecting on the death of her father—but with each new record her music becomes an even more personal, ecstatic and richly layered collage. Madres deftly combines house music with field recordings from indigenous communities, the Peruvian cajón drum, clips from a protest against homophobia and pan-Latin American rhythms. Kourtesis makes restorative, kaleidoscopic house music that blooms from her heart and tugs at the strings of others, highlighting the power of dance floor healing. -Katie Thomas Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music

### Various - Chants Of The Holy Oyster (Kalahari Oyster Cult)
> Kalahari Oyster CultVarious - Chants Of The Holy Oyster Chants Of The Holy Oyster celebrates six years of Rey Colino's Kalahari Oyster Cult, documenting the Amsterdam label's increasingly singular footprint on contemporary club music. Connecting the dots between various corners of '90s dance music—from dreamy IDM to spacious electro, squelchy trance to wiggly tech house—Colino's vision updates these sounds, rather than basking in nostalgia. With contributions from best-in-school producers such as Roza Terenzi, Sansibar, Maara, Priori and more, the compilation serves as a great reminder that the fruits of the '90s are still ripe for renovation (and innovation). -Bella Aquilina Listen: Bandcamp

### Brutalismus 3000 - ULTRAKUNST (Live From Earth Klub)
> Live From Earth KlubBrutalismus 3000 - ULTRAKUNST Over the last two years, Brutalismus 3000 have become one of the biggest techno acts in Europe through sheer force of will and attitude. Their music, which they call "anti-techno" or "nu-gabber-post-techno-punk"—and they won't say it, but it's also kind of bloghouse—is confrontational but also funny. They channel the outlandish vibe of early electroclash acts and dress it up in an outfit thrifted from Humana that you might see walking down Warschauer Strasse on a Friday night. Tales of murder, excess and scene-baiting ("Safe Space") are soundtracked by short-circuiting electronics, making for a gleeful LP as giddy as it is confrontational, leaving a path of destruction and laughter in its wake. -Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Mun Sing - Inflatable Gravestone (Planet Mu)
> Planet MuMun Sing - Inflatable Gravestone Inflatable Gravestone, the title of Mun Sing's debut album on Planet Mu, neatly summarises the fantastical world the Giant Swan cofounder operates in: a cold, hard symbol of death is turned into something squashy and playful. The music on Inflatable Gravestone folds listeners into that strange and wonderful land, like jumping on a bouncy castle that deflates and re-inflates without warning. The textures are intense ("Squabble"), the rhythms jolting, swerving and sometimes falling off into oblivion ("Gliding"). And it all ties together with an underlying absurdity ("Spider"). It's a place only a truly brilliant and off-kilter mind could conjure up. -Sophie McNulty Listen: Bandcamp

### Natural Wonder Beauty Concept - Natural Wonder Beauty Concept (Mexican Summer)
> Mexican SummerNatural Wonder Beauty Concept - Natural Wonder Beauty Concept On their self-titled debut album, Ana Roxanne and DJ Python aim to massage out the beauty in loneliness and alienation. Floating on tides of ambient synths, the duo employ emo rap, synth pop, lucid breakbeat and more to explore the substrates of deep connection and unspoken tenderness. Avant-garde instrumental flourishes seamlessly blend into metropolis-at-night atmospherics. Roxanne's ethereal singing plucks at every fibre of your being, while Python's intricate percussion arrangements are modulated until they begin to trickle like water. These two masters of contemplative, shoegazey electronica come together for a debut that lives up to its name and more. -Emeka Okonkwo Listen: Bandcamp

### Ciel - Homesick (Parallel Minds)
> Parallel MindsCiel - Homesick The miracle of globalised contemporary electronic music is how artists have imprinted their own unique cultural identity into their productions. The stylistically and geographically roving debut album from Ciel is one such example, melding downtempo, ambient and electro. Ciel, who was born in Xi'an, China, and came of age in Toronto, based Homesick on eight types of traditional Chinese instruments, each of which correspond to the individual track titles. The most striking among them is the anxious tremble of "Metal," interpolated between syncopated drums, and "Silk," all sly chimes and rotund basslines. Conceptually rich, Homesick embroiders the disparate textures of Ciel's Eastern home and her Western world into one elegant tapestry. -Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Pangaea - Changing Channels (Hessle Audio)
> Hessle AudioPangaea - Changing Channels Festival FOMO moment of 2023? It's gotta be Ben UFO unleashing Pangaea's "Bad Lines" at Dekmantel. The happy hardcore-inspired anthem was the coda to the UK artist's short but magnificently sweet album, Changing Channels, which nailed the hard-to-wrangle cocktail of silly yet classy. In one fell swoop, Pangaea wrote the tune of the summer, doffed his cap to the hardcore continuum and poked fun at dance music's current obsession with speed and neon sounds—all with a massive smile on his face. -Carlos Hawthorn Listen: Bandcamp

### K-Lone - Swells (Wisdom Teeth)
> Wisdom TeethK-Lone - Swells Swells dropped on July 7th, a few days before I made my annual pilgrimage to Love International festival. In Tisno, the sea sparkles, the air is hot and the buzz of the cicadas in the trees is omnipresent. I listened to the glossy ripples of K-Lone's second album as I lay by the water, felt the sun on my skin and closed my eyes to allow my body to recover from the night before—the setting was just right. There are a couple dance floor-leaning tracks on the LP ("Love Me A Little," "Gel"), but Swells is largely made up of elastic tunes that slip, slide and undulate like the lapping of waves on a shoreline. Eliza Rose's vocal appears in hazy manipulations throughout (most notably on woozy R&B cut "With U"), accompanying colourful tones, melodies that glimmer and chords that melt into each other. -Katie Thomas Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Deena Abdelwahed - Jbal Rrsas (Infine Music)
> Infine MusicDeena Abdelwahed - Jbal Rrsas Tunisian artist Deena Abdelwahed has a predilection for pulling sonic touchpoints from the MENA region and dissolving them into dense, at times confrontational, productions. Case in point is opener "The Key To The Exit," her interpretation of the EDM-adjacent working class Egyptian genre mahraganat. It's a stunner of jagged synth lines that, in spite of its influences, feels like an electronic cousin to doom metal riffs. "Six As Oil" is just as intrepid. Abdelwahed slings around a fugue of subterranean drones, sustained sirens and tight snares to make for a deliciously anti-authoritarian rallying cry. -Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Oceanic - Choral Feeling (Nous'klaer Audio)
> Nous'klaer AudioOceanic - Choral Feeling Why do we sing? It remains one of the great mysteries of human evolution. But to open your mouth, vibrate your vocal chords and produce musical tones through exalting air is at the core of being human. To do so in unison with others is a tradition that can be traced back time immemorial. On his debut album, Oceanic reimagines choral music for the 21st century, chopping, warping and distorting the voices of 30 friends to create Choral Feeling. Equal parts odd and profound, the vocals are often distorted beyond recognition, whether drawn out into haunting melodies or woven into drum patterns through syncopated rhythms. Oberman stays true to choral music's antiquated roots, producing a capacious vision of human connection, one that is mysterious, kaleidoscopic and fundamentally beautiful. -Bella Aquilina Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Fever Ray - Radical Romantics (Rabid Records)
> Rabid RecordsFever Ray - Radical Romantics Fever Ray's third album is probably the closest that Karin Dreijer's solo project has come to sounding like The Knife, and that's no bad thing. Across ten outré pop tracks that range from the political to the almost hilariously personal (like when they threaten their child's bully on "Even It Out"), Dreijer belts out some of their catchiest hooks over neon-hued production from Trent Reznor, Nídia, Peder Mannerfelt and more. Where Dreijer's past work has revelled in alien unintelligibility, Radical Romantics puts its journey of self-discovery, emotion and passion out there for everyone to see, in all its pseudo-tropical, plastic-palm-tree and artificial beach glory. -Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Purelink - Signs (Peak Oil)
> Peak OilPurelink - Signs Signs, the stunning debut album from Chicago trio Purelink, occupies a nook all of its own in the broad realm of chill-out music—too feathery to be IDM, yet too alert to be ambient. This dubby netherworld, all gentle donks and silky earworms, evokes masters like Jan Jelinek and Lowtec. There's tension and dialogue. In short, don't be fooled into thinking this is background music—you'll be sitting bolt upright within minutes, marvelling at the wisps, wafts and occasional distant chime. It's all too beautiful to ignore. -Carlos Hawthorn Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

## [The Best Mixes of 2022](https://ra.co/features/4064)
Date: 2022-12-21T13:00:47.000Z

### Fact Mix 878 (Juba)
> JubaFact Mix 878 Zipline through a pastiche of Afro-electronic sounds, both domestic and diasporic. Juba, a British-Nigerian DJ who was recently featured in our newest episode of Soundtracking, cherrypicks from gqom, global club, techno and amapiano (the scene's consistent genre du jour) with an energetic panache more often reserved for dancers in front of the decks. The hour-and-a-half, which "ends on a rhythmic high," in the artist’s own words, boasts cameo tracks from the veritable who's-who of the Black underground: DJ Lag, Anz, DJ Swisha, Griffit Vigo and Juba's close friend and promising talent Gafacci. At a most unexpected apotheosis, she tucks in a tasteful Avicii bootleg by Dee Traits as well as the Pearson Sound remix of Nick León's "Xtasis (feat. Dj Babatr)", AKA RA's track of the year. Both inclusions mirror two ubiquitous trends of 2022: the Latin-infused techno and pop edit predilections of the underground—signifying the savviness of a selector in the know. All in all, the mix delivers an uppercut of infectious optimism in a new chapter defined by post-pandemic growing pains. —Whitney Wei

### fabric presents (Leon Vynehall)
> Leon Vynehallfabric presents Creative pressure is a very real thing for artists. How does one constantly evolve and meet—even surpass—their best work? Leon Vynehall seems to know the answer. Since 2018's powerful conceptual album Nothing Is Still, the UK musician has matured from a talented club producer into a storyteller par excellence, weaving original and compelling narratives through sound. 2019's RA-recommended DJ-Kicks was one of the best mixes that year. Now, in 2022, he's charted again. Like DJ-Kicks, fabric presents Leon Vynehall is all about dynamics, except this time the focus is on the club. You'd think that might be restrictive, but Vynehall is a master at finding common threads and energies in disparate musical worlds. Here, work by Mala, A2, Or:la, Ehua, Lady Blacktronika, Commodo, Hagan, Skee Mask and textures from so many other producers hang together in a smoky, soulful soup. The stitching is sublime, the music consistently excellent. At points, it's enough to take your breath away. —Carlos Hawthorn

### Live At Dimensions 2021 (Joe Delon)
> Joe DelonLive At Dimensions 2021 Hot take: Joe Delon likes dance music more than just about anyone. He tours all the time, but still finds time to write a regular newsletter about everything going on around him. As a DJ he exudes enthusiasm, playing groovy records that run the gamut from sleek contemporary tech house to old school Italo classics. This live recording from Dimensions captures his range perfectly: he starts low and slow, but just as things get a bit heady, he makes a U-turn with the outrageous vocal track "Adventure" by Eleanor and Shep Pettibone. From there, things dart between the cerebral and the cheesy. Vintage hip house gives way to G-funk-laced electro and acid before dissipating into celestial techno and old school rave. It's hard to imagine that even the security team wasn't losing it during this masterclass in Tisno. —Henry Ivy

### Accidental Meetings Podcast #72 (Yumi)
> YumiAccidental Meetings Podcast #72 New York DJ Yumi was probably a new name to a lot of people when they first heard this mix for UK platform Accidental Meetings, but anyone who did listen was probably left hungry for more. This 66-minute journey is the kind of unassuming but carefully built mix that lays eggs in your brain and hatches weeks later. Eventually, before you know it, you'll memorize every transition. Speaking of transitions, they're all remarkably seamless as Yumi blends together odd tracks at various tempos, gradually pulling off a 30 BPM change so impeccably that you barely notice it. Maybe RA staffer livwutang put it best in one of the SoundCloud comments: "dude [this] is fucking wild… im glad im alive to hear this sound." —Andrew Ryce

### HÖR, January 13 2022 (D Dan)
> D DanHÖR, January 13 2022 Berlin-based DJ and Mala Junta resident D.Dan had a big year. Seemingly unknown during the recesses of the pandemic, he catapulted to international acclaim in the last 18 months, not only because of his unanticipated glut of speed-demon dance floor releases—all of which skirt the 150 BPM mark—but also because of his position at the helm of a refreshing new trend towards nimble, groovy techno. His HÖR Berlin mix from January this year perfectly encapsulates this style. Minimal yet replete with understated hooks, it layers psychedelic flurries of toms with tribal drums, house vocals and trancey melodic fills. Strategically moving from rhythmic tracks to deep peak-time riffs and back, he showcases here why he's become such a lauded underground tastemaker—and a name to watch. —Chloe Lula

### Juanita's 063 (Quest?onmarq)
> Quest?onmarqJuanita's 063 "Spiraling" is a concept central to quest?onmarq's work. The New York-based DJ hosts a Lot Radio show of the same name, which sees them exploring a vast range of genres, from breaks to gqom, experimental and the harder regions of techno. They are not only technically skilled, but they have also been gifted with an insatiable curiosity about music, which allows them to play pretty much anything. For the 420-themed mix series, Juanita's—a platform on which DJs typically showcase the slower, sweet-tempered end of their collections—quest?onmarq turned to hazy breaks. The windswept mix breezes past early works like Equinox's rattling "Taking Over" to contemporary jungle like "For The Headstrong" by Tim Reaper & Response. It's a tutorial in considered pacing, showcasing how to play fast while maintaining a subdued energy. —Kiana Mickles

### Untitled 909 117 (Toumba)
> ToumbaUntitled 909 117 Dubby, dark and loaded with gnarly bassweight, Toumba's Untitled 909 Podcast is a beastly mix that infuses halftime mutations with a sense of industrial-tinged dread. It's a perfect introduction to the Amman-based artist, whose style nods to Nervous Horizon, Hessle Audio (home to his latest EP) and Nyege Nyege Tapes. The up-and-coming producer shows off his love for tectonic basslines, footwork, hiphop, Middle East folk rhythms and hybrid club music from the developing world during this 80-minute session, which features South Korea's NET GALA gqom ensemble Phelimuncasi reworked into a glitchy bricolage, as well as Dua Saleh's delicate trap. Toumba plays for the dance floor, but he's not afraid to indulge in experimental atmospherics and distorted textures either. This sense of adventure makes this mix powerful—and a whole lot of fun. —Nyshka Chandran

### Honcho Podcast Series 108 (Kilopatrah Jones)
> Kilopatrah JonesHoncho Podcast Series 108 On September 15th, Haitian-born, Queens-based DJ Kilopatrah Jones wrote on Instagram: "When you think of house music, what do you think of? For me, it's house dancing, getting free on the beat with a friend [you] made on the dance floor." The 108th edition of the Honcho Podcast Series, delivered by Jones as a special Pride mix, encapsulates this feeling—the joy of dancing, moving your body in sync with the kindred spirit on the dance floor you met just moments ago. Full of piano riffs, sensual vocals and a whole lot of groove, Kilopatrah Jones's Honcho offering is an hour of brilliant, ecstatic house that will make you dance until you sweat. —Katie Thomas

### BSU 066 (Truly Madly)
> Truly MadlyBSU 066 It's possible that Michael Joyce, AKA Truly Madly, is jumping between two or three different tracks in the first six minutes of his Butter Side Up Mix. It's also entirely possible that Joyce owns a 12-inch that somehow overlays sweeping chords with gurning rave stabs, rolling hand drums and short-circuiting electrical currents. The fact that we'll likely never know the answer is part of the fun (plus, it's not like we'd be able to find any of the records he plays anyways). This two-hour treasure trove of all things '90s sees Joyce in particularly bouncy and jubilant form. There are Latin-flavored rhythms, vintage NY vocals, and little bits of proper late night garage. The mixing is seamless without being showy, and Joyce keeps us on the edge of our seats the whole time, wondering what Shazam-breaking gem he'll reach for next. —H.I.

### Live From Sugar Hill (Jon K)
> Jon KLive From Sugar Hill Striking twists and turns are what make Live From Sugar Hill such a sharp and dynamic mix worthy of the physical media it was released on. Taken from Jon Kraus's set for Club Night Club at Brooklyn’s Sugar Hill Disco in September 2021, the cassette (released this year) niftily winds through bouts of grime, baile funk, gqom, ballroom and Jersey club like an alpine skier through a mogul field. Moments of more atmospheric, experimental tunes tease respite here and there, but Kraus knows the attention span of a dance floor all too well. On Live From Sugar Hill, a volley of breaks or a wall of kick drums is always only just around the corner. —Joseph Francis

## [The Best Tracks of 2022](https://ra.co/features/4098)
Date: 2022-12-20T15:45:42.000Z

### Nick León feat. DJ Babatr - Xtasis (TraTraTrax)
> TraTraTraxNick León feat. DJ Babatr - Xtasis If 2022 belongs to anyone, it's Nick León. The Miami producer is at the forefront of a new wave of 305-area artists who fuse together the city's unique tapestry of Hispanic cultures—and its deep connections to Latin America—with its robust dance music history. León specifically mixes influences from reggaeton and perreo into what is sometimes termed "Latin tribal techno," but whatever you want to call it, there's no denying the appeal of "Xtasis," the track most of us heard out on dance floors more than any other, by a country mile. "Xtasis," a collaboration with Venezuelan raptor house pioneer DJ Babatr, is a good example of the intercontinental cross-pollination happening within this scene. The percussion plays a trick, both four-on-the-floor and broken at the same time, at a chemically-enhanced pace with distant vocal wails that add a lysergic flair. But "Xtasis"—and its accompanying Pearson Sound and Doctor Jeep remixes—really clicks with the old-school organ bassline that drops in at about the two-minute mark. It's something so simple, so familiar and, frankly, genius, that by the time the kick drum drops back in, the room should be in a frenzy. If it isn't, then you're probably in the wrong place. —Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Kelela - Washed Away (Warp Records)
> Warp RecordsKelela - Washed Away It's a special, and rare, moment when music drops and completely disrupts the flow of the internet. This was the case with Kelela's "Washed Away," her first single since she put out her acclaimed debut album Take Me Apart five years ago. During the hiatus, she looked inward and studied literature on misogynoir, Black labour and racial capitalism. Suffused in hazy pads and reverbed vocals that sound more like mantras than vocal refrains, "Washed Away" could be perceived as the release of all this collective pain. In a recent interview with Dazed, Kelela described the single as a "heart check-in," a song recorded to "send out a clear message to Black people, who are my core audience and who I intend this music for, that you n***as are worthy."

### Rhyw - Honey Badger (Voam)
> VoamRhyw - Honey Badger On paper, "Honey Badger" shouldn't work. Its main drum line moves in and out of time with the impatience of a toddler hammering at a sequencer. The sole synth—the closest the track has to a melody—is aggressively abrasive, as if it were made from a substance somewhere between quicksand and sandpaper. But I'll be damned if it isn't one of the catchiest tracks I've heard all year. Undeniably weird, but equally infectious, if you heard the track out (and odds are you did if you went to a festival this summer), it sent every crowd into full blown meltdown. Walking away from any set where it was deployed meant that there were punters with their heads still spinning trying to shriek along to those metallic snares. —Henry Ivry Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### A+A - Eternal September (AD 93)
> AD 93A+A - Eternal September Both times I heard "Eternal September" this summer I didn't know what it was. On each occasion, it was sunrise at a festival, those blissful hours when time seems to stand still as the sky changes from milky to glowing. It's an ideal track for those hazy moments, with swathes of lush organ chords and fluttering high notes that swoop around like birds with silk wings. When Avalon Emerson and Anunaku (AKA TSVI) shared the upcoming release online, Midland commented on the former's Instagram saying: "I have played these songs and had a nice time while doing so!" To which I thought: I have danced to these songs and had a nice time while doing so! —Katie Thomas Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### DJ Plead - Come Quick (Livity Sound)
> Livity SoundDJ Plead - Come Quick DJ Plead usually plays and produces slick, percussive zingers that meld traditional rhythms from the Middle East with high-tempo dance music. But on his second offering for Livity Sound, the Nervous Horizon core member switches out his frenzied pace for a more pared-down tone. Drums remain his core ingredient but the mood is more whimsical, making the record feel more like a score to a picnic in the park rather than a party. Despite its light-hearted nature, "Come Quick" is still loaded with sharp corners and jolting melodies—a true day to dusk record. —Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Ahadadream - Spaceship (More Time)
> More TimeAhadadream - Spaceship Imagine Lunice, DJ Lag, Roska and Benga linking up for a recording session, and you start to get a sense of what "Spaceship" sounds like. On an EP filled with massive, celebratory tracks, Ahadadream's "Spaceship" was colossal. Every few bars it felt like he was shifting his reference points. What starts as a UK-funky-meets-gqom hybrid morphs into a dubstep throwback with its airy, descending melody. But then the xylophone chimes and upbeat snares capture the maximalism of TNGHT records. As the inadequacy of comparison should make clear, though, "Spaceship" is sui generis, announcing the arrival of a new torchbearer for all things big and bassy. —H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Pariah - Caterpillar (Voam)
> VoamPariah - Caterpillar It's been a few years since Pariah put out any solo material (he's primarily active as one half of Karenn alongside Blawan). It's been even longer since he released dance music in his own right. Caterpillar, then—which came out in June on Voam, the label he runs with Blawan—is an exciting interruption to this interlude. The hypnotic title track is capital-T techno, but it's heavily textured and nuanced, layering dense modular noodlings with a repeating guttural squelch that sounds more like an off-the-cuff live rip than the polished veneer of most of today's peak-time output. Flanged-out percussion, sizzling analog stabs and a spacey, Pole Group-like synth lead make it the ultimate selection for breaking open a late night set. —Chloe Lula Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### DJ Python - Angel (Incienso)
> InciensoDJ Python - Angel At first listen, it's almost unbelievable that Brian Piñyero, better known by his pseudonyms DJ Python and Luis, creates his ambient reggaeton in Ridgewood, Queens. "Angel," off of his EP Club Sentimientos, Vol. 2, has a lot of heart and an even gooier center in its sonic embrace of supple electronics. The ten minute-plus track feels like a weekend-long sojourn into a daydream far from the Halsey L stop, as lush—almost levitating—synth pads breathe deeply around pattering tablas and soufflé riddims. Within its sumptuous depths, there's an earnest, refreshingly unironic appeal to softening, unfolding and tenderness. —Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Sally C - Downtown (Big Saldo's Chunkers)
> Big Saldo's ChunkersSally C - Downtown When Sally C released the second EP on her label Big Saldo's Chunkers back in April, the tracks had already been doing the rounds for almost a year. Most notable was "Downtown," a big, brash, in-your-face hip house roller that encapsulates what Sally C and her pals mean when they refer to a "chunker." This is functional, no-nonsense dance music that does exactly what it needs to: make your body want to move and groove. The vocal samples are textbook—"Put the needle on the record" and "Do you want to dance?"—but they're a consummate companion for a tune designed to keep the party pumping, proof that less isn't always more. —K.T. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Nikki Nair - Step 2 (n goes to infinity)
> n goes to infinityNikki Nair - Step 2 It's hard to imagine following dance music in 2022 and not hearing at least a handful of Nikki Nair tracks. The genre-hopping polyglot was everywhere with everyone, establishing a tight but all-over-the-place sound that blends electro, drum & bass, jungle and footwork. Case in point, "Step 2," which kicked off Nair's own label n goes to infinity. It starts out as hectic uptempo acid jungle track, before crescendoing into a halftime breakdown full of metallic skronks and other aural detritus. It's like walking from a FABRICLIVE night into a Daedalus set circa 2011, and then finishes off with a sprightly techno-jungle jig that feels completely of the moment—an era that Nair is helping define with each new release. —A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### GiGi FM - Manas (PST) (Bambe)
> BambeGiGi FM - Manas (PST) GiGi FM's first signed EP, Magnetite, supposedly holds "spiritually-charged techno mantras." While that may conjure a suite of vaguely spiritual motifs, we get none of that on this kinetic four-tracker. "Manas (PST)" embodies her aesthetic most distinctly, nodding subtly to the artist's sometimes collaborator, Donato Dozzy, with its deeply tribal percussive intro. The rest of the song is beguilingly simple; the propulsive kick-and-tom pattern continues uninterrupted under a single-note cowbell, never changing except for a brief drop about two-thirds in. GiGi FM, an alumnus of both the New York City Ballet and the Alvin Ailey Theatre, has said that the release is a testament to the ritualistic relationship between movement and music. This synergistic dynamic is elegantly elicited on the EP's A2, which is trance-inducingly danceable. —C.L. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Heavee - Sonic Warfare (Hyperdub)
> HyperdubHeavee - Sonic Warfare Heavee's Audio Assault was probably our favourite record on Hyperdub this year, with six tracks of inventive hybrid footwork that capture the label's ethos to a T. The best example was probably "Sonic Warfare"—which shares its name with Kode9's book—a blend of jabby footwork drums, eerie synths and a melodic motif that stutters and fades like electrical interference. —A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Physical Therapy - Emotional Rescue (Allergy Season)
> Allergy SeasonPhysical Therapy - Emotional Rescue Physical Therapy spent the last four years working diligently behind the scenes on his label, Allergy Season, as well as releasing records via a slew of his other aliases (Car Culture, DJ Overnite and Fatherhood, his project with Michael Magnan, to name a few). His last release under his original moniker, the 2015 EP Million Years Crushed, was deep, busy and granular. His latest album, Teardrops On My Garage, sounds like a subdued version of Physical Therapy. The garage-inspired chopped vocals are pitched-up and sweet, the melodies resonant and rich. My personal favourite, "Emotional Rescue," is an edit of Tru Faith's "Let The Beat Hit 'Em," that brightens the source material's original vocals with a sparkling melody and rollicking breaks. —K.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Isabella Lovestory - Exibisionista (Self-released)
> Self-releasedIsabella Lovestory - Exibisionista Reggaeton has been undergoing a renaissance in the electronic music world in recent years as artists like Rosa Pistola and the trio Sangra Nueva dissect dembow loops with a toolbox of global club rhythms, producing a kaleidoscope of sub-genres. Among those fringe styles is perreopop, and Isabella Lovestory is one of its leading faces. Here, her sultry lyrics and cam girl aesthetic take on an almost spooky air thanks to producers Nick León and Kamixlo who inject elements of dub and industrial into classic dancehall patterns. Transforming what would have been a regular pop song into a deadly dance floor weapon, the trio are a bright example of reggaeton's futuristic sector. —N.C. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Eliza Rose & Interplanetary Criminal - B.O.T.A. (Rosebud Recordings)
> Rosebud RecordingsEliza Rose & Interplanetary Criminal - B.O.T.A. If, when one of SASS played "B.O.T.A." at around 8 AM on the Sunday morning of Love International, someone had said to me: "This tune's going to be #1 in the UK," I probably would have laughed and suggested it was time for bed. "B.O.T.A." was the summer's most ubiquitous tune, yes, but in my universe of clubs and festivals. Or so I thought. Skip to Friday, September 2nd, 2022, and Eliza Rose & Interplanetary Criminal had scored the UK's 1,400th #1, the first-ever for a woman British DJ. The percussion is simple and buoyant, the chords are warm and the vocal is catchy as fuck; "B.O.T.A." is a flawless summer bop. —K.T. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Nia Archives - Forbidden Feelingz (HIJINXX)
> HIJINXXNia Archives - Forbidden Feelingz British jungle revivalist Nia Archives began her astronomical year releasing a slew of hits du jour and ended it by winning a MOBO award in the ceremony's very first electronic/dance music category. "Forbidden Feelingz," an accelerated Amen break-laden single off her eponymous EP, combines elements of dub and reggae with a distinctly rough-and-ready, old-school UK feel. Nia Archives enthusiastically borrows vintage sensibilities, so the spectre of sound system culture still haunts this one, but to a timeless and earwormy effect. —W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Maara - Lezzies In A Jacuzzi (Radiant Love)
> Radiant LoveMaara - Lezzies In A Jacuzzi Montréal-based Maara has cultivated a fun and femme queer aesthetic that found an appropriate home on the Berlin label Radiant Love. Her EP on the imprint, Goddess Within, features four Goa-leaning trance tunes accompanied by whimsical titles like "Mommy's In Trouble" and "Goddess Within (Give It To Me Daddy)." But it's "Lezzies In A Jacuzzi" that takes the cake for name and substance alike. This anthem layers heavily gated vocals over a throbbing kick and swooning, euphoric pads. Thoughtfully-placed flourishes—a breakbeat fill, a call-and-response arpeggiated synth—elevate this song from cheesy crowd-pleaser to considered dance music production. If the Canadian artist is pointing her ship towards prog, then we're jumping on board. —C.L. Listen: Bandcamp / Soundcloud

### Margaret Dygas - Butterfly Effect (Half Baked Records)
> Half Baked RecordsMargaret Dygas - Butterfly Effect The best minimal tracks are all about attention to detail, so it should come as no surprise that Margaret Dygas' "Butterfly Effect" clocks in at 9:09. The track is immersed in the micro world of details as she dilates and contracts looped conga drums, 909s, a creeping synthline and stormy pressure from her subs. Simple but effective, Dygas approaches these elements with a surgeon's precision as she moves them up and down in the mix. This was Dygas's first 12-inch in over half a decade, a welcome return of one of minimal's weirdos-in-chief. "Butterfly Effect" is a reminder of the strange sense of wonder that only the best minimal can create, where it feels like a loop could go on forever. —H.I. Listen: Soundcloud

### Utada Hikaru - Somewhere Near Marseilles (Epic Records)
> Epic RecordsUtada Hikaru - Somewhere Near Marseilles The year's greatest grown-and-sexy jam came out of an unlikely collaboration between the biggest J-pop star of all time and UK house producer Floating Points. Starting with the flicker of an acid line, "Somewhere Near Marseilles" unfolds over 11 minutes of exquisitely produced house, bobbing and glimmering in all the right places. Hikaru sings what feels like three different choruses in a mixture of English and Japanese, glamourously exhorting their lover to meet them in Marseilles as an in-between point between London and Paris. "Let's go fast, then go slow," they repeat over the constantly morphing instrumental track. It's a snippet of luxury and contentment that feels as lush as the song sounds, only improved by Hikaru's impeccable vocal performance—the way she sings, "I'm in London / You're in Paris" is both commanding and effortlessly cool. It's rare that the pleasures of pop and house music come together this well, a cosmopolitan adult contemporary jam made for the most amourous hours of the night. —A.R. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify

### Kush Jones - BX Bounce (Self-released)
> Self-releasedKush Jones - BX Bounce Growing up in New York, it's nearly impossible not to be inundated by different strains of music. The summer streets come alive with reggae and hip-hop; house music wafts in through FM radio or from the cracked window of your longtime neighbour. The vital life force and diversity of the city's sounds has coloured Kush Jones's discography over the years. He typically releases music—drawing from house, jungle, footwork and hip-hop—independently at a fast clip. One of his many works from this year was 6 Days, an EP that was written in, you guessed it, six days. Within a record that shifts rapidly between house and juke, the highlight comes from the pensive pads, idle, honey-sweet melody and subtle percussion on opener "BX Bounce," embodying the very best of New York's intangible cultural heritage. —K.M. Listen: Bandcamp

### Beyoncé - BREAK MY SOUL (Columbia Records)
> Columbia RecordsBeyoncé - BREAK MY SOUL When Beyoncé released the first single from her album Renaissance, souls weren't the only thing she broke. The internet, arbiter of half-baked opinions, waxed enthusiastic about house music's reinvigoration within the commercial mainstream. In many ways, "Break My Soul" was formulaic in its hitmaking: it flung gruff yak'ing samples of New Orleans bounce legend Big Freedia ("release ya trade / release the stress / release the love / forget the rest") into a looping bassline inspired by Robin S.'s 1990 smash "Show Me Love"—even tapping into the post-pandemic cultural zeitgeist of saying "fuck it" and quitting your job. But the key to any liberation anthem is confidence, not necessarily originality, and Beyoncé stands on the shoulders of the tried-and-true house heroes that came long before her to successfully ignite the masses. —W.W. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Peggy Gou - I Go (Soulwax Remix) (Gudu Records)
> Gudu RecordsPeggy Gou - I Go (Soulwax Remix) In the remix circuit, Soulwax hold a god-tier status. Known for transforming pop, indie and rock classics into expansive dance music epics, the Belgian duo don't take themselves too seriously, tending to zero in on hands-in-the-air euphoria. Their reworking of Peggy Gou's "I Go," is fun-loving to the core, but it's also a potent warehouse banger. Teasing out the original's delicate vocals and retro synths against a fierce, almost mechanical bassline, the remix balances both light and heavy textures with a masterful touch. The breakdowns are on-point, the quirky bird call sample is delightful and there are no boring moments. Soulwax strikes again. —N.C. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Shanti Celeste - Cutie (Hessle Audio)
> Hessle AudioShanti Celeste - Cutie As an illustrator, Shanti Celeste has a predilection for bright, happy hues—a blush pink to be precise, if we use her latest EP artwork as a reference. Her Hessle Audio debut adds a welcome splash of colour for the label in the form of two tracks and a Central remix that fizz with winsome positivity. Opener "Cutie" is the standout, idiosyncratically Shanti in its nimble drums and gossamer pads, with a pitched-up, corkscrew of a vocal she recorded herself. It skips along at 140 BPM, settling in the playful sweet spot where heads-down, driving house meets radiant and beatific textures. —K.T. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Skin On Skin - Burn Dem Bridges (FFRR)
> FFRRSkin On Skin - Burn Dem Bridges It seems unbelievable that it took someone this long to combine UK drill and techno as perfectly as this. It only took an Australian to do it. In a year that saw his star rise almost absurdly rapidly—and deservedly so—Skin On Skin blew us away with "Burn Dem Bridges," which samples a Sav'o and Horrid1 track and saddles it onto an urgent techno beat with an addictive descending bassline. The whole thing sounds ready to blow at any minute. It's remarkable how a rhythm can change the cadence of a vocal so much, and in Skin On Skin's hands, both drill and techno sound completely fresh, fiery and unstoppable. —A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Two Shell - home (Mainframe Audio)
> Mainframe AudioTwo Shell - home Impersonators showed up to their Boiler Room to play a pre-recorded set. Their first interview was taken off the internet in mere hours. Two Shell blew down the doors of 2022. And while some of their gimmicks may split opinions, "home" was a unifying track beloved by the dance music community. The single marked a new direction for the London duo, setting them apart from their peers by creating a completely singular sound where bubblegum pop meets UK bass. A frothing breakbeat at 160 BPM drives the track under its SOPHIE-reminiscent vocal, meanwhile its neon melodies burst like fireworks across the stereo spectrum. "home" will be remembered the way "Hyph Mango" was, marking the entrance into some unknown, but exciting era of UK club music. —H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### KH - Looking At Your Pager (Self-released)
> Self-releasedKH - Looking At Your Pager In many ways, 2022 was a massive year for pop music. Underground club producers have long played out cheeky edits of '90s chart-toppers in their DJ sets, but it felt more prominent this year. Under his KH alias, Four Tet brilliantly reworks 3LW's "No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)," autotuning the original lispy vocals against a mean bass synth and a cooing, sparkling melody that feels straight out of a nursery rhyme. It's teen pop in holy matrimony with garage-like beats, plus a faint hint of dubstep—a combination that only someone like Four Tet could pull off. —N.C. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### SHE Spells Doom - Bossano (All-centre)
> All-centreSHE Spells Doom - Bossano "Trying to see how African rhythms combine with techno for me is an experiment," said Wamya Tembo AKA SHE Spells Doom in an interview with the Zambian press. "[I like] seeing how far you can push it while still making people want to dance." His latest Afrobeat techno tune, "Bossano," toys with tension with the poise of a tightrope walker. Bursts of percussion ruffle the song’s militant batida march, punctuating every bar of sci-fi synths while also teasing the ruckus of a street party throughout. Like an ellipsis, it brings you to the edge of your seat—or rather, the tips of your toes. —Joseph Francis Listen: Bandcamp

### Paurro - Galavisión (Cómeme)
> CómemePaurro - Galavisión This lean breakbeat house number serves as a definitive introduction to Paurro's dynamic sound. Combining UK garage and dub influences with psychedelic effects, "Galavisión" is the kind of immersive groove that lends itself to escapist fantasies. Whether hearing it at home or at the club, it's easy to be transported into a lush dream state, one where pleasure and instinct hold more currency than logic. Paurro understands the power of skippy rhythms and low-end frequencies, letting them shine without indulging in too many choppy breaks. With its clear '90s influences and rollicking drums, "Galavisión" is perfect for both peak time and after hours. —N.C. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Jennifer Loveless - Around The World (Butter Sessions)
> Butter SessionsJennifer Loveless - Around The World Galloping, loopy house abounds on this Melbourne producer's EP for home-turf label Butter Sessions. "Around The World" encapsulates the experiences of being a contemporary jetset flâneur, whose lackadaisical saunters are replaced with fast-paced globetrotting. This all seems immediately interpreted through glitchy, disembodied vocals—like filtered announcements over an intercom—and roving, rotund basslines that seem to spend the entire seven-plus minutes attempting to catch up with themselves. Loveless's perspectives bounce—quite literally—in palpable optimism. There's an dazzling array of life out there to see, and simply not enough time to see it all. —W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Joy Orbison - Pinky Ring (Hinge Finger)
> Hinge FingerJoy Orbison - Pinky Ring No year-end list is complete without a Joy Orbison banger. If the South Londoner's talent is distilling pockets of the hardcore continuum into original bitesize chunks, "Pinky Ring" is a particularly golden nugget. Breaks, drum & bass, post-dubstep, possibly even electro? It's all in there, and yet the track feels anything but retro. Making the past sound fresh and futuristic could well be Joy Orbison's greatest skill. —Carlos Hawthorn Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### D. Tiffany & Roza Terenzi - Edge Of Innocence (Delicate Records)
> Delicate RecordsD. Tiffany & Roza Terenzi - Edge Of Innocence Electronic music is something of an ouroboros: sounds hark back to the past as trends recycle in a never-ending loop. The revival of genres like jungle and trance, among others, is proof positive, and the subject of many articles from cultural critics like Simon Reynolds and Mark Fisher. But there's a distinction to be made here. Some artists' chase of rose-tinted nostalgia is nothing more than empty cliché, while others treat their return to a bygone era like a hero's journey—familiar, yet eclipsed by a new, fortified sensibility. D. Tiffany and Roza Terenzi achieve the ideal balance on their debut album, Edge Of Innocence. It offers a mélange of influences that run the hi-BPM gamut from electro to drum & bass without losing grip of the rippling, psychedelic groove at the core of everything this duo do. "Grains Of Sand" is a case in point, replete with synths that stab through a thicket of lumbering percussion, as is the fittingly named breakbeat bop "Redemption Arc," kitted out with all the sleek dynamism that emerges after a period of dark contemplation. By the end of Edge Of Innocence, you get the feeling that, though the duo are working with well-worn sounds, they've made them all their own. -Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Hudson Mohawke - Cry Sugar (Warp Records)
> Warp RecordsHudson Mohawke - Cry Sugar Ross Birchard told us he only works up the nerve to make a solo album about every seven years, and this time it was worth the wait. Like a summary of his history of making weirdo IDM hip-hop and mainstream rap, Cry Sugar is the Glaswegian producer's most epic and wide-ranging LP, chock full of earwormy melodies, left-turn smackdowns and the symphonic pomp-and-circumstance that makes his work one of a kind. You can hear the last ten years of rap music refracted through Birchard's many-sided prism, which is often as funny as it is heavy as it is genius. Like the title implies, Cry Sugar careens from the depressed to the euphoric, each feeling pumped up to the scale of a Marvel movie. -Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Black Rave Culture - Black Rave Culture Vol. 2 (Black Rave Culture Records)
> Black Rave Culture RecordsBlack Rave Culture - Black Rave Culture Vol. 2 One of the most potent club weapons this year, the second offering from Washington DC supergroup Black Rave Culture is a motley crew of historical dance music styles from across the Black diaspora. Representing East Coast club, junglist rhythms and sunny house music with a truly holistic, cross-genre vision, the album teems with grit, unbridled energy and most importantly, power. From the baile funk underpinning "Never Left" to the '90s rave ethos of "Peace Plan," these tracks jump across styles effortlessly, and the fine-tuned production of members Amal, DJ Nativesun and James Bangura holds it all together. -Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Kerri Chandler - Spaces And Places (Kaoz Theory)
> Kaoz TheoryKerri Chandler - Spaces And Places When it comes to making music, too many house and techno legends struggle to hold a candle to their younger selves. Not Kerri Chandler. The US house giant's latest album, Spaces And Places, is a three-hour epic stacked with the kind of tasty grooves and lush instrumentation we've all been gobbling up for 30 years. That its 24 tracks were mostly recorded inside the clubs and venues they pay homage to is both a remarkable feat and a quirky novelty. But it also speaks to something more profound: Chandler's global, enduring popularity. -Carlos Hawthorn Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Shygirl - Nymph (Because Music)
> Because MusicShygirl - Nymph As someone who's been listening to Shygirl since her breakthrough single, "Want More," it might have come as a surprise that the UK artist only released her debut album this year. But as the saying goes, good things take time. This record, aptly titled Nymph—a play on words nodding to the album's whimsical nature and bawdy undertones—is Shygirl in full effect. The vocalist's hooks are tighter than ever, and the ever-expansive production spans pastoral pop, raunchy hip-hop, nostalgic Eurodance and the kind of saccharine hyperpop that trends on TikTok. More than just an excellent first LP, Nymph is a masterclass on collaboration, boasting production credits like Sega Bodega, Arca, Mura Masa and more, whose work melts effortlessly into Shygirl's one-of-a-kind style. -Kiana Mickles Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Carmen Villain - Only Love From Now On (Smalltown Supersound)
> Smalltown SupersoundCarmen Villain - Only Love From Now On Norwegian musician Carmen Villain has a preternatural ability to evoke a sense of cold, uneasy beauty. Her fourth album, Only Love From Now On, features ambient compositions that are often startling in their psychological intrigue. On "Future Memory," Villain expertly braids the sounds of cooing birds, humming flutes and irregular heartbeats to build suspense. "Liminal Space" conjures something similar, except with the inclusion of what seems like faint, irregular footsteps that stumble closer and further away. With its disarming atmospherics, Villain's fourth full-length has nothing to declare—only quiet intensities to whisper. -W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Waajeed - Memoirs Of Hi-Tech Jazz (Tresor)
> TresorWaajeed - Memoirs Of Hi-Tech Jazz Waajeed's debut on the prestigious Tresor label is a tribute to his hometown of Detroit, as a rousing tribute to both Black leisure and resistance against oppression. Conceptualised with a mini road trip around the Motor City—specifically, from the his own Underground Music Academy to Belle Isle—Memoirs Of Hi-Tech Jazz connects the dots between Detroit's rich musical traditions, encompassing jazz, deep house, minimal techno and marching band music. Even the title, a reference to the Underground Resistance subgroup Galaxy 2 Galaxy, reflects Detroit's storied sonic lineage. Proud, joyous and unapologetically local, Waajeed's love letter to his hometown is packed with velvety tones and lustrous chords that acknowledge the past and pave the way for the future. -N.C. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Marina Herlop - Pripyat (PAN)
> PANMarina Herlop - Pripyat Do you ever wonder how the world looks through a baby's eyes? Everything's new, and nothing makes sense. It's just one brilliant, ever-shifting mirage of colour and sound. Marina Herlop's third album, Pripyat, dazzles in a similar way. Where the Catalan artist's first two records showed off her expert piano playing and freeform, wordless vocals, Pripyat goes a step further into the unknown, patching together her classical training with dissonant electronics, and even weaving in an ancient Indian singing style called konnakol. The album might share its name with a ghost town, but Herlop's Pripyat is alive and bright with boundless imagination. -Joseph Francis Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Whatever The Weather - Whatever The Weather (Ghostly International)
> Ghostly InternationalWhatever The Weather - Whatever The Weather While Loraine James was working on her acclaimed 2021 LP Reflections, Loraine James filed away several songs that would ultimately make up her self-titled album, Whatever The Weather. On this meteorology-themed album, James did away with her club sound completely to write a series of ambient tracks distinguished by a worn, melancholy beauty. Here, intermittent rain is depicted as a flurry of lustrous synths, "14°C" is transformed into pensive arpeggios—the playfully jagged IDM she's revered for—and sounds hiccup and stop-start across placid pads all over the LP. As an artist whose main project emphasises tricky beats over strikingly subdued terrain, her pivot to producing a downtempo record—and doing it so well—makes perfect sense. -K.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Soichi Terada - Asakusa Light (Rush Hour Music)
> Rush Hour MusicSoichi Terada - Asakusa Light Before this album, Japan's deep house don hadn't released a full-length in over 25 years. But it's abundantly clear that he hasn't lost his touch. There's a light, almost weightless, feel to this 11-track LP as the Tokyo composer and producer shows off his mastery of twinkling chords, spacey disco grooves, vintage synth patterns and video game sounds. Asakusa Light is relatively sparse—even its big-room tracks like "Bamboo Fighter" feature relatively minimal arrangements—which allows his signature melodies to really shine. Graceful and flowing, this is an album that celebrates Terada's craft without feeling like a pastiche of his '90s discography. -N.C. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Marcel Dettmann - Fear Of Programming (Dekmantel)
> DekmantelMarcel Dettmann - Fear Of Programming Marcel Dettmann has always earned more attention for his DJing than his productions, but real fans know that his discography is a treasure trove of dark, detailed techno. Fear Of Programming, which lands on the all-purpose Dekmantel label, is something different: bright, vibrant, even a little funny (thanks to a vocal guest spot from fellow Berghain resident Ryan Elliott). Fear Of Programming is loaded with bold, bassy techno and arresting ambient passages. The real gold is in the hooks, which the spartan but still powerful production emphasizes like a gold frame around a masterpiece painting. It's the work of someone who knows techno inside-out, and knows how to make it compelling without going too far outside the box. -A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Hagan - Textures (Python Syndicate)
> Python SyndicateHagan - Textures With his debut album Textures, the South London DJ and producer Hagan celebrates the intersecting cultures close to his heart with rich, percussion-driven music. Organic flourishes (Ghanaian group chants, windswept koras and sunny guitar lines, to name a few) broaden the horizons of his historically urban sound palette, and he truly comes into his own as an all-around songwriter. With expertly curated vocal collaborations that reflect on family and faith, elements of gqom, amapiano and highlife, Textures is a transportive ode to the drumming continent, and the meaning of growing up both within and away from it. One moment you're in a lush, jungly landscape, the next you're hustling in the streets of Accra. Textures is more than just African dance music; it's a vibrant amalgamation of all the ingredients and influences that make Brendan Ware Hagan. -Emeka.Okonkwo.

### Deepchord - Functional Designs (Soma Records)
> Soma RecordsDeepchord - Functional Designs All of Deepchord's records are good—all of them—but a few are extra special. Functional Designs falls into this category. On first glance, it's not all that different from his countless other LPs. You've got gaseous dub techno beats echoing out into a painstakingly woven web of field recordings, sure. But the melodies are bigger, the drums are heavier and, most importantly, the tracks are separate, each with its own hook, its own uniquely staggered rhythm. Creating another noir-ish world of rainy-night ambiance, Functional Designs is one of Deepchord's most approachable and immersive LPs, gently refurbishing the rock solid formula of dub techno that the Detroit artist has relied on for decades. -A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Björk - Fossora (One Little Independent)
> One Little IndependentBjörk - Fossora Björk spent a lot of time dancing and thinking about mushrooms during lockdown. From this—a time she described to Pitchfork as her "fungus period"—came Fossora, the Icelandic vanguard's tenth album. Björk has been making music for over three decades now, and with each record she steps into mystical, uncharted territory, creating work which is ever more beguiling, more avant-garde and always, somehow, even more Björk. On Fossora, Björk sings with a sweeping gravitas over rich woodwinds and distorted gabber beats, the additional instrumentation dancing around her vocal as she muses on the circle of life, nature and her own late mother. Digging her fingers into the earth, Björk unknots tributaries of tangled roots, the crashing drum patterns and complex textures representing the stark, breathtaking topography of her homeland. -Katie Thomas Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Huerco S. - Plonk (Incensio)
> IncensioHuerco S. - Plonk From the first three seconds of Plonk, you know Huerco S. isn't doing the misty ambient thing again. Plucked strings ping in various directions, like popcorn exploding in a pan. Or, to be more accurate, like parts of a car yawning into gear. The automotive-inspired album, his first in six years, takes the American artist's sound to strange and innovative places—new sounds, unexpected textures, a first-ever vocal cameo. Isn't this what great artists do? Evolve, take left turns and, crucially, always deliver. -C.H. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Kode9 - Escapology (Hyperdub)
> HyperdubKode9 - Escapology Britain has never felt so close to collapse as it did in 2022. Between prime minister jockeying, mini-budgets and a volatile currency, Steven Goodman returned as Kode9 with a record that made the perfect accompaniment for the instability of the modern UK landscape. Written to accompany an experimental video game about Scotland leaving the union, Escapology operates along a dual axis, at once anxious—filled with eerie bits of sci-fi chatter and dense layers of swelling feedback—but also hopeful, at least when he turns to club tracks. "Uncoil," for example, is a pearl half-covered in sand somewhere between drum & bass and footwork, while "Cross The Gap" uses the negative space of dub to create something glimmering in the weight of the darkness around it. -Henry Ivy Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### DJ Lag - Meeting With The King (Ice Drop)
> Ice DropDJ Lag - Meeting With The King After years pushing the Durban scene and helping to make the sound a global sensation, anticipation for DJ Lag's debut album, Meeting With The King, was sky-high. He used the opportunity to champion his community instead of his own glory, creating a record that is collaborative from start to finish, with a majority focus on artists hailing from his home country of South Africa. Meeting With The King takes the moody sonics of the gqom—born from township house parties—and makes it polished, opulent, even melodic, honouring the origins of the sound while adding catchy elements of amapiano, house, Afrotech and more. The title is boastful, but it's not wrong—on Meeting With The King, DJ Lag stakes his claim and continues his ascent, taking his musical family along for the ride. -K.T. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify

### Schacke - Apocalyptic Decadence (Instruments Of Discipline)
> Instruments Of DisciplineSchacke - Apocalyptic Decadence Martin Schacke—of "Kisloty People" fame—has a knack for writing a hook. And almost every track of his debut album is decadent and addictive, loaded with catchy melodies. While the first half of the release gestures towards new beat and EBM—"Miasma Of Filth" and "Tasteless Passion" both pull from a lineage of tinny 808s and mid-tempo industrial—the second half offers grade-A techno-pop made for the the dance floor. Songs like "Body Type" and "Dungeon Crawler" are deceptively simple production-wise, but their repetitive choruses are the stuff that makes crossover hits. It's easy to imagine waiting for the train in the early morning hours after the rave, deliriously looping these brash three-note motifs again and again through your head. -Chloe Lula Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Ron Trent presents WARM - What Do The Stars Say To You (Night Time Stories)
> Night Time StoriesRon Trent presents WARM - What Do The Stars Say To You Ron Trent's WARM project captures it all in the name. As the Chicago house genius has advanced in his career, he's slowly luxuriated into a silky fusion sound that plucks from jazz, Balearic and soft rock in the spirit of carefully considered collaborators, like Texan psych-rock trio Khruangbin or Italian ambient composer Gigi Masin. "Admira," for instance, unfurls alongside loose bongo drums like a satisfying slow yawn after a midday slumber. Dappled sunlight patchworks "Flos Potentia," bound together by strumming bass guitar, and "On My Way Home," an earnest, jazzy sonic panacea for the oft-jaded ennui of modern music. After a long 11 years away from the format, Trent's latest album is a gorgeous evolution to behold. -W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Jamal Moss - Thanks 4 The Tracks U Lost (Modern Love)
> Modern LoveJamal Moss - Thanks 4 The Tracks U Lost Jamal Moss, under his own name and as Hieroglyphic Being, is one of the defining forces in Chicago dance music. Whether he's making jacking house, experimental noise or blown-out techno, his work is defined by its sense of pure energy as he whips his machines into a frenzy. You'll find plenty of that rawness on his first LP for Modern Love, but where Thanks 4 The Tracks U Lost stands apart is in its surprising tenderness. Don't get me wrong—the drums have plenty of edge, and Moss still pushes his synthesizers to their breaking points—but the record is strikingly wistful, making for one of the most beautiful and tenderhearted of the many albums he's released. -H.I. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Beast Nest - Sicko (Ratskin Records)
> Ratskin RecordsBeast Nest - Sicko In their work as an organiser and mediator, Beast Nest, AKA Sharmi Basu, believes that healing should be a communal effort. The process for making Sicko could be described as a collective effort. The LP was recorded in the years following 2016's tragic Ghost Ship fire, which ended up killing 36 people in an unlicensed warehouse. Sicko was an integral part of their healing journey as a survivor. There's palpable catharsis written into the energetic pulse of the album, which bleeds several genres into a satisfyingly cohesive mix that makes it difficult to discern where one song ends and another begins. Ambient sequences with knotty sections that twinkle and flutter turn into spaced out dub and then, somewhere along the way, listeners are transported to post-punk-leaning IDM. The songs sprawl out slowly, but capped at six tracks, the LP is actually quite short, emblematic of the slowness of grief and the unpredictable, dynamic moments that accompany it. -K.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Sudan Archives - Natural Brown Prom Queen (Stones Throw)
> Stones ThrowSudan Archives - Natural Brown Prom Queen Sudan Archives has always been a jewel of eccentricity. On her boundless second album, Natural Brown Prom Queen, rewind-worthy lyrics, maximalist experimentation (and what might be the most beat switches per song this year) coalesce into one remarkable document of self-empowerment and discovery. She embodies both her inner child and the person she's becoming ("I just wanna build LEGOs / I just wanna build, let's go"), all while keeping her signature sultriness dialed up to the max. Even putting her signature violin to the sidelines doesn't distract from her unique songwriting style. By the time she brings it home on the closer, "#513," she's delivered a defiant manifesto of hedonism, joy and femininity that raises the bar when it comes to post-genre pop music. -E.O. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Tanya Tagaq - Tongues (Six Shooter)
> Six ShooterTanya Tagaq - Tongues Amid an ongoing reckoning with Canada's own history of indigenous genocide, Inuk artist Tanya Tagaq's sixth album approaches this legacy with righteous fury and surprising tenderness. An extension of a book of verse of the same name, Tongues takes stock of decades of violence and its effects on the bodies and minds of a people, but also recognizes the power one can possess in even the most hopeless of circumstances. Combining her traditional throat singing with English words wielded like daggers, it's a disarming and personal listen that makes the historical personal, underlining the scale of a tragedy but also the resilience and power of those who have survived it. -A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Steffi - The Red Hunter (Candy Mountain)
> Candy MountainSteffi - The Red Hunter For the past five years, Steffi has been refining a style of electro that sits somewhere between bruising club weaponry and crystalline IDM sound design. The Red Hunter broadens this palette to include touches of hip-hop and contemporary club music, while keeping the nuts and bolts of classic Detroit in place. The result is the best full-length of her career. On The Red Hunter she creates a singular cosmology where strange, stuttering drum patterns emerge underneath windswept melodies and contracting basslines. But even as she moves into far-flung realms, she never loses sight of the club, and almost every single one of these tracks would make a head-turning standout in a DJ set—which is what we've always come to Steffi for in the first place. -H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Mall Grab - What I Breathe (Looking For Trouble)
> Looking For TroubleMall Grab - What I Breathe In just a few years, Mall Grab went from master of a niche to king of everything. His debut album is a Chemical Brothers-sized crossover behemoth, attacking every form of radio-friendly dance music, from big room house to pounding jungle. It's inspired by the sounds of his adopted home of London, and to his credit, it captures what makes the city so enduring in dance music history. A restless blend of sound system culture, American and European imports and the kind of vocal hooks you hear on BBC Radio 1—with a few vocal turns from the man himself—it transforms Mall Grab from bedroom producer into something closer to a pop star. -A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Dopplereffekt - Neurotelepathy (Leisure System)
> Leisure SystemDopplereffekt - Neurotelepathy Gerald Donald and To-Nhan Le Thi of Dopplerekkeft's second LP, like many 2022 albums, emerged from the toils of pandemic-induced isolation. The album's accompanying press text loftily asserts that its ten tracks are "considerations of the machine-human interface" and "transformative mental, psychological and transgenerational states." While some of these (perhaps overwrought) academic themes come through in the album's titles, it mostly sounds like the duo's mood piece-like electro fare—in the best possible way. The tracks throughout Neurotelepathy aren't predictable arrangements made for club play. They're spare and considered, making exquisite use of spatial sound design, spectral percussion and arpeggiated melodies. Some songs, like "EEG," take more than a minute to settle into a more legible song structure, but their expertly rendered craftsmanship make them worth the wait. -C.L. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### 700 Bliss - Nothing To Declare (Hyperdub)
> Hyperdub700 Bliss - Nothing To Declare Spoken word and darbuka drums join in holy matrimony on this joint album from 700 Bliss—Philadelphia-based Moor Mother and DJ Haram. As the first full-length work from the duo after a series of collaborative EPs, Nothing To Declare sees the two artists claiming their matriarchal stake in electronic music. Haram's frenetic electronics speak in dialogue with Moor Mother's throaty vocals, delivered with a potent urgency. "Things ain't been the same since they put the lynch on us / water thicker than blood they convinced us," Ayewa opines. She's always been fearless in her delivery, but it's Muzeyyen's jagged productions that drive the point home. -W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### ABADIR - Mutate (SVBKVLT)
> SVBKVLTABADIR - Mutate SVBKVLT became one of the most important club music labels by showcasing the vital Shanghai club scene, though the label's purview has expanded and only become more vibrant in the process. Case in point: this LP from Cairo producer ABADIR, which combines a freewheeling style of jungle with Arabic rhythms. This is music that sounds permanently out of breath, feeding off its own excitable energy. Inspired by maqsoum music and the humid bustle of the Egyptian capital, Mutate features impossibly funky beats shrouded in thick field recordings and melodies that hang in the air like smog. It's a vision of the kind of global club music that SVBKVLT has always championed, and one of the best records in a catalogue that constantly ups the ante for where club music can go next. -A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Batu - Opal (Timedance)
> TimedanceBatu - Opal According to the International Gem Society, an opal is "distinctly individual"—more so than any other gemstone. The 3D-rendered opal on the cover of Batu's debut album is just that: a unique kaleidoscope of colours. Icy blue, vibrant green and a hot, lava red contrast with the grey underside of the opal and the moody background. Examining Opal's cover gives a strong sense of the sounds within. 11 tracks of sharp (though sometimes soft), complex and unpredictable electronic sculptures, a world of intricate sound design that Batu said he intended to feel vivid and transportive. Like so many LPs released this year, Opal is a lockdown record, made when Batu was in an introspective and contemplative state of mind, experimenting with moving away from club 12-inches and into a space more vulnerable and experimental. -K.T. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### FKA twigs - Caprisongs (Young)
> YoungFKA twigs - Caprisongs Caprisongs was one of the first RA Recommends of the year, and it was no surprise to many of us that it lingered long enough in our minds to make this end of year list. The album is brighter than anything we'd heard from twigs before. Gone is the operatic austerity of MAGDALENE. Instead, Caprisongs is a pop album with a capital P. The album mines from Afrobeats, grime, baile funk and R&B. It also sources from her personal life via snippets of conversations she recorded with loved ones. The immersive world she creates here deals with insecurity, "stupid boys" and friendship, but it's also celebratory. The world had opened up, after all. Twigs might have had a cry now and then, but at least she was doing it on the dance floor in the album's first single, "Tears In The Club.". As phenomenal as Caprisongs is, it's somehow even more impressive because it was pulled off with a welcome sense of humour. The album title, for example, is inspired by astrology—her "stubborn Caprisun ass telling her to work through the pain." Listeners can even eavesdrop on an astrological reading by the album's close. Sometimes, a little stubbornness is worth it. -K.M. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

## [The Best Mixes of 2021](https://ra.co/features/3952)
Date: 2021-12-22T13:00:01.000Z

### Presents: Eargoggles (Theo Parrish)
> Theo ParrishPresents: Eargoggles "There are no genres. Nope, there's none. It's all tune for tune," Theo Parrish said outside the familiar NTS stall in Dalston's Gillett Square. And he doesn't just talk to talk. Many DJs claim to play across genres, but there are "many DJs" and then there is Theo Parrish. Over the past few years, the historically private artist has given fans a near-unprecedented view into his creative mind, first with the lengthy and unclassifiable sonic essay-meets-radio drama We Are All Georgeous Monsterss, and then this year with a six-and-a-half hour mix for NTS called "Eargoggles." (Parrish also dropped another six-hour mix close to press time.) Eargoggles is a marathon celebration of the infinite diversity of Black music, spanning from hard bop to hip-hop, searing psych rock to roots reggae. No random grab bag, this is a grand narrative and the revelation of a modern canon of soul with appearances by James Brown, The Congos and D'Angelo. The mix is an education unto itself—around hour five Parrish drops "Jazz Cats Part 1," a cut consisting of Madlib breathlessly laying out his key jazz influences—yet it's also a generous statement of purpose bursting with joy and urgency. 25 years into his career, Parrish gives us an exhaustive guide to the music that makes him tick, that has informed his own enduring classics. But why now? He explains the gravity of his convictions in the final moment of the magisterial "Eargoggles" mix: I'm hoping that at some point during this... After you've had a ride, a musical ride with me, that you take a moment to consider the troubles that you have, and consider that you're lucky to have them. Even if it doesn't affect you demographically, you should seriously consider the fact that there's an urgency that should be lived, in respect for those that get taken from us early under the guise of 'serve and protect.' So let's survive together. But let's remember them together as well. Let's not forget how we treat each other when the music's playing and how things change when the lights go on and we all go back to the rest of our lives. Let's go back with a little more urgency and care for the fellow man. Let's give a damn a little bit. And if we can do that, we got a better place.—Matt McDermott

### BIS Radio Show #1085 (Tim Sweeney)
> Tim SweeneyBIS Radio Show #1085 Over the past 21 years, Tim Sweeney never missed a week on the WNYU airwaves, hosting generations of DJs in the college station's basement studios. Beats In Space became iconic over this decades-long stretch, with Sweeney joining a grand tradition of New York radio DJs that also includes Shep Pettibone, Tony Humphries, Stretch and Bobbito, who held sway and influence far beyond the five boroughs. Though Sweeney has since brought Beats In Space back via Apple Music, last March he unexpectedly wrapped up his term on WNYU with episode #1085. Listeners flooded the comment section on a YouTube livestream after the news broke, thanking him for his illustrious tenure. For the finale, Sweeney played Beats In Space classics that highlighted the show's connection to the history of New York City dance music, dropping in an eclectic selection from Alicia Myers, Chaz Jankel and Arnold Jarvis. Full of hope, the two-and-a-half hours imparts a heartfelt message of gratitude to dedicated listeners and guests alike.—M.M.

### borshch mix 26 (Crystallmess)
> Crystallmessborshch mix 26 We're in the age of the polymath musician, and Crystallmess is the epitome. The French-born Ivorian and Guadeloupean DJ, producer and mixed media artist (who has shown her work at the Centre Pompidou and the Geneva Biennale, as well as playing at hallowed institutions like Berghain), has steadily made her way into the art and electronic music vanguards simultaneously. For her entry in the Borshch Magazine series, Crystallmess uses the mix format to express the social whiplash of lockdowns and reopenings, all the while showing off her agile genre-agnosticism. She includes edits of beloved Lil Wayne and Aaliyah tracks, blown-out jungle sampling "Ready or Not" by The Fugees, swirled with a heavy-handed dose of otherworldly ambient to evoke the expansive solitude of pandemic isolation.—Whitney Wei

### Lost In Dreams (Irini)
> IriniLost In Dreams Lost In Dreams was another entry in the growing SoundCloud archive of Traumprinz's resplendent multiverse. Irini, one of the elusive artist's many pseudonyms, trots out over three hours worth of new material, charting a comprehensive course in sensitive dance music from someone who creates at a relentless pace. Unlike some of his other aliases, irini doesn't have a unique sound in the way that DJ Healer or the Prince Of Denmark do, but that's also what makes this mix so rewarding. The dub techno, UK garage, even minimal house productions spring forth from an enigmatic source, keeping the intrigue of listening alive. Now it's just a matter of waiting for the inevitable vinyl releases.—Henry Ivry

### ETCHED 003 (Live Set) (Wata Igarashi)
> Wata IgarashiETCHED 003 (Live Set) A live set from techno's undisputed master of arpeggios, Wata Igarashi, is a special thing no matter where it takes place: dark basements or—why not—the Nobeyama Radio Observatory. Located in Yatsugatake, Japan, the observatory has been a hub for radio astronomy research since 1982. Its imposing rows of satellites and telescopes, set against a beautiful landscape, provide an almost too-good-to-be-true backdrop for Igarashi's cosmic, otherworldly sound. Beautifully shot on video by ETCHED (an audiovisual project showcasing domestic artists), the set plunges into the outer reaches of Igarashi's unmistakable productions, reworking previous records and some unreleased material into an hour-long trip that remains one of 2021's most memorable techno sets.—Richard Akingbehin

### 100% UNRELEASED OSSX MIX (OSSX)
> OSSX100% UNRELEASED OSSX MIX For many of us, New Jersey group OSSX's "Split Wig" on Allergy Season was one of the year's indisputable anthems. And the only thing better than just one track is a whole hour of exclusive material. 100% UNRELEASED OSSX is a goldmine for anyone into big drums and even bigger melodies (with a "Split Wig" appearance early on). There's a light-footed touch to breakbeats, plus some nimble choppage and a parade of brazen, uplifting edits that sample a tongue-in-cheek gamut: Modjo to Janet Jackson to September's Eurodance hit "Cry For You." It's that "Are they really doing this? Sampling that?" swagger that cinches this mix as one of our endlessly replayable favorites this past year.—Andrew Ryce

### TTT Mixtape (Josey Rebelle)
> Josey RebelleTTT Mixtape Josey Rebelle could—and probably will, honestly—make this list every year for the foreseeable future, and it would be nothing short of deserved. The UK DJ is one of the best selectors on the planet, with a record digger's taste but a party-rocker's ear. She'll play obscure records, sure, but they'll never feel obscure. Her mix, first released as a very limited tape on The Trilogy Tapes in April, is a perfect example of this, stitching together slow jams, weirdo techno and even snippets of radio play, with a darker edge than what we're used to from some of Rebelle's recent mixes. The eventual streaming upload of the mix was greeted with the fervor of an album drop, and for good reason: this TTT Mix strums the eclectic but intuitive thread that’s tied through all of her sets. The only flaw is that it isn't twice as long.—A.R.

### GHOSTCAST 014 (DESYN)
> DESYNGHOSTCAST 014 In certain circles, the name Desyn Masielo commands a kind of reverence, and the London lifer has been blending the finest never-on-YouTube Discogs gems for the past two decades. Here, Masiello flaunts those deep-digging DJ tendencies with wild abandon. Ghostcast14, recorded live at Hoppetosse, is a good intro to what he can achieve when he goes for the jugular from the very beginning. We start in medias res with UK garage basslines, but his masterful pacing and mixing means that before we know it, we're zipping through starry rave, acidic electro, '90s house and just about everything else under the sun. For us mortal trainspotters, the only thing worse than having missed this party is that we'll likely never know what any of these records are.—H.I.

### Daisychain 154 (DJ Fart In The Club)
> DJ Fart In The ClubDaisychain 154 DJ Fart In The Club (AKA Soyoon Choi) certainly has an offbeat sense of humor, but when it comes to their DJ sets, they're entirely straight-faced. Even though this set came in at the tail end of last year, it still banged all the way through into 2021. The Berlin artist unleashes a sticky hour-and-a-half of acid-tinged wobblers, prog house and freaky trance for the Chicago-based, women and non-binary focused podcast series Daisychain. In the knottier sections, Choi takes listeners on a jaunt full of vertiginous peaks and deep valleys by roving into spiraling wormholes of techno, garage and preternatural club music.—Kiana Mickles

### sit on my interface (1/2) (CCL)
> CCLsit on my interface (1/2) In the weeds of the first 20 minutes of CCL's sit on my interface mix, it's easy to presume that this is a fully ambient offering. But that would be a hasty judgement, as once it approaches the one-hour mark, the energy intensifies with such careful, gradual restraint that even the active listener might wonder how they even got to this point. Sure enough, the mix ultimately reaches a dark, slinky plateau with a bubbling, percussive roller and then rockets off from there. "sit on my interface (2/2)" can't arrive soon enough.—K.M.

## [The Best Tracks of 2021](https://ra.co/features/3951)
Date: 2021-12-21T00:47:34.000Z

### Overmono - So U Kno (Poly Kicks)
> Poly KicksOvermono - So U Kno 2021 felt like Overmono's breakthrough year. Each new release of theirs seemed to outdo the last, from the euphoric rave of "Pieces Of 8" to their pitch-perfect fabric mix to the peppy garage of "Diamond Cut" (one of the major highlights from what was arguably the year's best Essential Mix). But it was "So U Kno," released not on the duo's usual home of XL Recordings but on their own, smaller Poly Kicks imprint, that made it into what felt like every DJ set of the post-reopening world. Like so much of Overmono's recent work, there's a whiff of a bygone, post-dubstep era to "So U Know." Built around an unforgettable vocal chop, "So U Kno" is the kind of track that elicits cheers from a dance floor the minute the DJ starts to mix it in. It has one of those in-between beats—kind of house, kind of 2-step, kind of techno—and a thrill-ride of a breakdown. Encapsulating the frenzied, overjoyed vibe of the summer's post-reopening clubbing with a hint of wistful nostalgia, "So U Kno" perfectly sums up this year's excitement and radical ups and downs.—Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Billie Eilish - Oxytocin (Interscope Records)
> Interscope RecordsBillie Eilish - Oxytocin Hidden in the middle of Billie Eilish's intimate, often confessional singer-songwriter album is one of the year's biggest, loudest club tracks: the pop megastar's equivalent of Nine Inch Nails' "Closer." "Cause I like to do things God wouldn't approve of / If she saw us," Eilish whispers over a clanging, outsized beat. "Oxytocin" takes the tactile, goosebump-inducing approach of Eilish's other records and blows it up to a macro scale. It's the sound of being cornered in the club, pushed towards the speaker until all you can hear are the kick drums.—A.R. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Elvin T - Get Close (Regraded)
> RegradedElvin T - Get Close Throw a jacking house rhythm underneath the right vocal and soaring strings, and you've found yourself a tried and true way to excite a dance floor. There is nothing radical or even innovative about Elvin T's "Get Close," which hews closely to this time-honored formula, but there doesn't need to be. The Philadelphia producer laced together the perfect combination of driving percussion, vocals, a glossy string loop and a couple of breakdowns. Released as the final record on Midland's Regraded label at the start of summer, the track's timing was also fortuitous as dance floors got busier over the summer. —Henry Ivry Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### PinkPantheress - Just for me (Parlophone)
> ParlophonePinkPantheress - Just for me TikTok made PinkPantheress one of the year's defining pop stars. She became a musical sensation just for releasing snippets of songs on the video app before the full versions appeared on streaming services. Anyone who hadn't heard of PinkPantheress probably did when she finally released the music video for "Just for me," an early '00s-inspired visual depicting her on a studio stage with a sulky crew of emo kids. The Mura Masa co-produced track nodded to garage and early '00s pop-rock, perfectly encapsulating "new nostalgic," a term PinkPantheress uses to describe her own sound. If the lyrics—which follow a stalker's infatuation with a crush—are unsettling, it's intentional. The song was inspired by the obsessive themes that run through Eminem's "Stan," and is more a practice in dramatic storytelling than a portrayal of real-life events. Much like the rest of her catalog, which is tailor-made for bright-eyed Gen Z TikTokers with short attention spans and a love for danceable, snappy hooks, "Just for me" hovers around two minutes in length—just long enough to make you want to press rewind and hear it all over again.—Kiana Mickles Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Planetary Assault Systems - Say It Loud (Token)
> TokenPlanetary Assault Systems - Say It Loud As Planetary Assault Systems, Luke Slater makes huge, no-bullshit techno. There's plenty of technical wizardry going on, sure, but you know what to expect: thunderdome kick drums and synths that sound like sonar pings. Enter "Say It Loud," the highlight from Belgian label Token's 100th release, which subverts Slater's historical output with a goofy sound that matches its goofy title (right down to the deadpan vocal repeating "say it loud"). Refreshing and zippy, it sounds a bit like Slater poking fun at the current crop of big-time techno producers, then beating them at their own game with a track that's over-the-top, funky and absolutely monstrous.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Soundcloud / Spotify / Soundcloud

### tondiue - Painted Creature (secondnature)
> secondnaturetondiue - Painted Creature tondiue's debut packed an album's worth of ideas into an EP of techno that explores the outer reaches of the genre, specifically slowed-down breakbeats and tunneling, Wata Igarashi-style arpeggio workouts. "Painted Creature" falls somewhere between these styles. What starts out as a loose hand percussion workout laced with clipped, unnerving vocal samples before the breakdown turns it into a tripped-out big room techno cut that could stand up with the best of 'em. It's just one of many highlights on a techno EP that sticks with us like few others have this year.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Nia Archives - Headz Gone West (HIJINXX)
> HIJINXXNia Archives - Headz Gone West Drum & bass was all over pop and R&B this year, though it rarely sounded as heavy and convincing as it did on Nia Archives' Headz Gone West, where the London singer peppers expert breakbeat chop-ups with jazzy vocal runs. The title track is an easy highlight, packing a whole lot into just over two minutes as Nia Archives sings about her anxiety, her wandering mind and getting "high just to pass the time" over beats that crest and wane like lashing ocean waves.—A.R. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / SoundCloud

### Stef Mendesidis - Stalker (Klockworks)
> KlockworksStef Mendesidis - Stalker Like his first EP for Ben Klock's label in 2019, Greek born, Kyiv-based producer Stef Mendesidis' Klockworks 33 delivered four irresistibly catchy, full-pelt techno tracks when it came out in October. "Stalker" is by far the most elegant cut of the batch, threading delicate hats and a single, sonorous pad in and out of an arpeggiated bassline that opens and closes over the course of five-and-a-half minutes. Like Klock, Mendesidis has mastered the art of functional peak-time techno that feels anthemic despite its simplicity.—Chloe Lula Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Logic1000 - I Won't Forget (Therapy)
> TherapyLogic1000 - I Won't Forget Logic1000's "I Won't Forget" had unfortunate timing, landing at the very beginning of the year when most of the world was still shut down. It has all the makings of a festival hit with its deliciously heavy slo-mo breakbeat and moody synths that come in halfway through the track, like tears blurring your peripheral version. Just when you think you have the track pegged down, everything falls away to reveal a truly evil-sounding Reese bassline that pushes it to another level. In all, it's a wonderful, canny fusion of UK dance music styles from a talented Australian producer.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### John Glacier - If Anything (PLZ Make It Ruins)
> PLZ Make It RuinsJohn Glacier - If Anything "If Anything" producer and Frank Ocean collaborator Vegyn originally found John Glacier's music on SoundCloud, but the London-based artists quickly realized they'd met before, gravitating towards each other to chat at the back of parties. It's appropriate, then, that "If Anything," the opening salvo from Glacier's debut album, brims with the swooning disorientation of a big night out. Over a triumphant, boom bap-influenced beat, Glacier raps in impressionistic turns of phrase: "Starlight, dancin' in the moon / I'm ravin' rabbit, I'm on shroom." "If Anything" introduces a visionary and arty MC with an instantly recognizable banger.—Matt McDermott Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### KG - Koko feat. Mista Silva (Black Acre)
> Black AcreKG - Koko feat. Mista Silva Karen Nyame KG earned the nickname "The Goddess of Rhythm" for her intricate UK funky productions, but the British-Ghanaian artist's biggest track to date came when she stepped up to the mic. "Koko" was an immediate summer hit that benefited from a magpie's approach to recent African dance music innovations. In just under three minutes, Nyame mixes airy highlife guitar, Afrobeats and amapiano. Her vocal, meanwhile, is unapologetically carnal: "Don't waste my time / I wanna bust down, bust down / Go rounds, go rounds / lights out, lights out." Modern dance music often feels like it's designed for some airless dungeon. By comparison, "Koko" feels like sex on the beach.—M.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Koreless - Joy Squad (Young)
> YoungKoreless - Joy Squad It's safe to say the Welsh producer Koreless got a little in his head while working on his debut album, which was almost a decade in the making. The time enabled him to do endless revisions and embark on creative soul-searching that eventually paid off. The LP's ten tracks display extraordinary sonic detail and inventiveness. "Joy Squad" sticks out as a granular reimagining of a big room anthem. Chopped-up shards of melody and vocals combine with cinematic strings in a kaleidoscopic funhouse of a track that would be overwhelming if it wasn't so concise.—M.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Maxwell Sterling - Decay Time (AD 93)
> AD 93Maxwell Sterling - Decay Time Turn Of Phrase reveals Maxwell Sterling as a rare talent, remarkably adept in both electronic sound design and orchestral arrangement. While the title track flabbergasts with a mix of furious classical runs and Autechre-level sound processing, the brief "Decay Time" is the record's centrepiece. While the drums clearly hearken back to IDM's '90s heyday, the track's plinking synth bass and strings converge to evoke a sense of deep lament. This difficult balance of head-spinning programming and lilting emotionality recalls classics within the genre like Aphex Twin's "Flim."—M.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / SoundCloud

### DJ Black Low & Kapzela feat. Licy Jay & MLG - Emonate Oe Bethela D Vosho (Awesome Tapes From Africa)
> Awesome Tapes From AfricaDJ Black Low & Kapzela feat. Licy Jay & MLG - Emonate Oe Bethela D Vosho Considering house and techno are inventions of the African diaspora, it feels like poetic justice that some of the most innovative changes happening in modern electronic music are emerging from the continent. In recent years, amapiano's log drum grooves have sprung from Gauteng townships to clubs around the world. DJ Black Low, the 20-year-old amapiano producer signed to Awesome Tapes From Africa, brought an experimental edge to the young genre on his 2021 album, Uwami. On "Emonate Oe Bethela D Vosho," Black Low works with Kapzela and the MCs Licy Jay & MLG to forge a groove that's as urgent as it is inviting.—M.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Currency Audio - Modus Choperandi (Exit Records)
> Exit RecordsCurrency Audio - Modus Choperandi Photek's 1997 hit "Modus Operandi" brought together the best parts of trip-hop, jazz, jungle and hip-hop. Consisting mostly of drums and atmospheric effects, it redefined drum & bass and celebrated the art of percussion itself. On his entirely improvised tribute to the track, Rajeev Maddela pulled from Photek's beat science, fusing recreated '90s breakbeats with live drumming and his own signature sound. Maddela's razor-sharp instrumentation—accentuated by ghostly pads—brought new depths to jazzy drum & bass this year.—Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Max Watts - Hipnautic (Self-released)
> Self-releasedMax Watts - Hipnautic Only recently exiting his teenage years, rising techno prodigy Max Watts has released some of the freshest renditions of Detroit techno this year. His self-described "post-Detroit" style is unique for its raw, improvisational flow, channeling the freewheeling energy of Midwestern techno greats like Underground Resistance, Claude Young and DJ Rush. Watts's sincere investment in the emotion and groove behind his music makes way for some of the purest and most exuberant modern techno around. One of the hits off April's MW002 EP, "Hipnautic," was a favorite for its lurching percussion, drunken, loopy melody and dissipating hi-hats. Watts knows how to build and retract momentum in all the right places.—K.M. Listen: Bandcamp

### Bapari - Daybreak (Self-released)
> Self-releasedBapari - Daybreak The "Ha" stab, a rousing "crash" sample that typically falls on the 4, is to ballroom music as vocal chops are to Jersey club. They're classic hallmarks of the genres—once you hear them, it's difficult to mistake what you're listening to. The key elements of ballroom music, a style intrinsically tied to its dance culture, have understandably caught the eye of numerous club producers in recent years. And Bapari, a Brooklyn-based artist whose music draws from all manner of East Coast club styles, is one of the latest to be inspired. On the title track of their Daybreak EP, the "Ha" stab, rather than assuming its traditional role of accentuating the melody, becomes the melody across a frenzy of playful, whip-sawing crashes. Offering some respite, Bapari skillfully tempered the track with plenty of space and the occasional murmuring vocal that floats off into the ether.—K.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Ayesha - Potential Energy (Scuffed Recordings)
> Scuffed RecordingsAyesha - Potential Energy There are a few simple but essential ingredients needed to make the perfect Ayesha track: nimble percussion, intoxicatingly psychedelic melodies and plenty of focus on the low-end. "Potential Energy" nails all three. The first gobsmacking moment arrives with synths that ripple with the intensity of an ultraviolet wave. Then the first acid lead slithers in, a portent of the brilliance to come: a rip-roaring showcase of lumbering breakbeats and off-kilter synths, replete with Saturday morning cartoon sound effects. It's a certified energy-boosting weapon for DJs on the late-late shift.—K.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### A.G - always, you (Self-released)
> Self-releasedA.G - always, you Breakout artist A.G not only has a penchant for creating robust, propulsive sounds, but she's got the bravura to back it up. Last year, the East London native postedMixmag's review of her August Discwoman selections, including the tongue-in-cheek caption "heavy-bodied means I'm thick." It's quips like these—and all the offerings on her donotdisturb EP—that shirk the stereotype of the introverted bedroom producer. In standout track "always, you," A.G demonstrates a magisterial command of UK drill, directing staccato hi-hats and pitched-up vocal samples to clamber over heavy bass uppercuts with a tenacity that matches her personality. When they say "confidence is everything," take this example as a case in point.—Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp / Spotify

### UNIIQU3 - Microdosing (Local Action)
> Local ActionUNIIQU3 - Microdosing When Jersey club royalty holds court, the world pays attention. Cherise Gray, otherwise known as UNIIQU3, has been championing the 135 BPM club music of her Newark home on the international stage for the better part of a decade, and this year she really came into her own. "Microdosing," the lead single off her Heartbeats EP, delves into house, rap and four-to-the-floor big room beats: "Took a tab and tripped / Drown in it / Fall into my abyss / The sticky icky wet wet." Gray details a lysergic wet dream that climaxes at peak time on the dance floor. Synth-heavy and oozing with confidence, the track holds the hip-swinging sashay of a lip glossed, sugar-coated seduction—without the predictable box spring squeaks.—W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Blawan - Under Belly (XL Recordings)
> XL RecordingsBlawan - Under Belly "Under Belly" has a little bit of everything that we've come to love about Jamie Roberts (AKA Blawan), from his early Hessle Audio days to his tech-wiz modular techno era. It also perfectly captures what has always been refreshing about his music: He never takes himself too seriously. With its groovy swing and ghost choir motif, "Under Belly" sounds like the most fun he's ever had on record. By looking back to his early days as an honorary post-dubstep protege, Roberts proves he can return to the past while still firmly developing his sound.—H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Anz - Unravel In The Designated Zone (OTMI)
> OTMIAnz - Unravel In The Designated Zone Anz broke out in 2020, but her career has taken off in 2021. Between her yearly all-originals mixes and an increasingly hectic DJing and radio schedule, the Manchester artist knocked out two of the year's most exciting celebrations of UK club music. While her Ninja Tune debut All Hours was a masterclass in fusing pop with electro, UK garage and jungle, "Unravel In The Designated Zone" remains the year's high water mark. It's a bit more understated, but it still feels like an instant classic from the moment the song's lead synth begins howling over her signature off-kilter percussion.—H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / SoundCloud

### SHE Spells Doom - Rudnick (All Centre)
> All CentreSHE Spells Doom - Rudnick There was plenty of genre-bending club music released this year, but Zambia-based SHE Spells Doom's release for All Centre was a hybrid like no other. The three-track EP showcased an impressive repertoire, crossing from UK funky to Afro house. But it was the confident swagger of "Rudnick" that kept clocking up the re-listens. The track's synth work has the technicolor polish of contemporary UK techno set over the stuttering swagger of '00s hip-hop percussion. Named for the sci-fi Oedipus anti-hero in the movie Heavy Metal, the track surpasses its namesake, creating a sense of noirish anxiety without losing sight of the funk.—H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Maara - The Forbidden Plum (Isla)
> IslaMaara - The Forbidden Plum 2021 saw a new sound emanating from Canada's dance music underground led by labels like Planet Euphorique, Isla and Acting Press. No one captured this better than Maara and her sexually charged, trance-flecked take on techno and electro. Across two breakout EPs, there was a je ne sais quoi to the Montreal producer's often illicit but lighthearted tracks. Her best song, "The Forbidden Plum" from her Potion Activated EP, had elements of both. Dark, pulsing synth bleeps, a twisted metallic bassline and a prog house throwback gated vocal sit under a repeated refrain: "Want it so badly." "The Forbidden Plum" is a cocktail of hedonistic indulgence.—H.I. Listen: Bandcamp

### SHERELLE - 160 DOWN THE A406 (BEAUTIFUL)
> BEAUTIFULSHERELLE - 160 DOWN THE A406 While SHERELLE expressed plenty of frustration over the pandemic in 2021—and even scolded the UK government in a broadcast for Newsnight—her debut EP was surprisingly light. The A-side, "160 Down The A406," is pure joy, featuring an airy chord progression, dreamy mallet melodies and chipmunk vocal cries all sewn into a breakbeat reverie. Although we can't in good faith recommend doing 160 MPH on the A406, we can put our weight behind this fuzzy footwork-jungle fusion, which showcases how SHERELLE can flex in the box just as much as she can behind the decks.—Emeka Okonkwo Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### MC Boing (Danny L Harle) - Boing Beat (Mad Decent)
> Mad DecentMC Boing (Danny L Harle) - Boing Beat MC Boing is one of the four new aliases Danny L Harle uses on his debut album. With "Boing Beat," he channels early '00s happy hardcore with spellbinding results. As part of the LP's virtual club experience—a four-story rave complex called Harlecore—Harle's tributes border on parody at certain moments. But at others he stumbles upon gold. "Boing Beat" is unapologetic, E'd-up euphoria taken to unnatural highs with MC Boing's manic vocals and Hannah Diamond's girlish, synthetic hook.. While Boing's half-screamed deliveries can be jarring at times, with lyrics as wholesome as "Everyone here is safe and nice / Makes me wanna have a great life," how could we do anything but smile and dance?—E.O. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### LSDXOXO - Sick Bitch (XL Recordings)
> XL RecordingsLSDXOXO - Sick Bitch Between those buzzing synth lines and RJ Glasgow's robotic but commanding vocals, "Sick Bitch" by LSDXOXO could easily become this generation's "Satisfaction" by Benny Banassi. The Berlin-based producer and DJ pulled even fewer punches than usual on his XL Recordings debut, opting to go full thrust with lyrics so raunchy they'd leave a conservative news anchor on life support. Talk of testing gag reflexes and exploding in one's own clothes leaves nothing to the imagination and can put every room it's played in in an erotic headlock—or at least a sensual trance.—E.O. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Calibre & DRS v Mark Ernestus - Badder (Signature Records)
> Signature RecordsCalibre & DRS v Mark Ernestus - BadderBasic Channel cofounder Mark Ernestus made a relatively rare turn to the mixing console with "Badder," linking up with drum & bass legend Calibre to craft understated and moody dub techno. The song samples the original "Badman," featuring DRS, and subtly riffs on its name. Things get hypnotic as DRS's vocal chops ripple and echo through the mix, while a snare that threatens to land never does. All the while, hi-hats tick ominously like the second hand on a watch. The shadows loom larger in this dark makeover, a bass-heavy maze rife with riveting tension.—E.O. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Fiyahdred - Anyway (Do It) (Hyperdub)
> HyperdubFiyahdred - Anyway (Do It)Press officers will tell you tunes are anthems when they're not. But Hyperdub wasn't messing around with "Anyway (Do It)." This club singalong is a blast of fresh air, blending gqom, amapiano and UK funky with an insanely catchy vocal about rolling spliffs and generally not giving a fuck. There's nothing more exciting than a new artist breaking through with absolute fire. On the strength of this banger and the rest of their excellent debut EP, 2022 could be a life-changing year for the burgeoning UK producer.—Carlos Hawthorn Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Jossy Mitsu - Ø (Astral Black)
> Astral BlackJossy Mitsu - ØTwo wins stand out for Jossy Mitsu in 2021: becoming a resident at London club fabric and releasing her debut EP, Planet J. The impressive thing about her productions is how they echo her DJ sets, distilling a love of dubstep, UK garage, techno and jungle into a fresh, convincing package. The pick of the bunch was "Ø," named after Hyperdub's groundbreaking London party. The track's title informed its contents: dark, slinky and dripping in wall-rattling UK energy.—C.H. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

## [The Best Albums of 2021](https://ra.co/features/3950)
Date: 2021-12-15T21:27:34.000Z

### Space Afrika - Honest Labour (Dais Records)
> Dais RecordsSpace Afrika - Honest Labour Listening to Honest Labour feels like street lights burning onto tired retinas and long nights of feeling small in a big city. On their sophomore album, producers Joshua Inyang and Joshua Reid created a series of nocturnal meditations, a series of nineteen short tracks bleeding into one another, in tribute to their hometown of Manchester. The duo's instrumentation is replete with field recordings of urban white noise, balanced by resonant cellos, hazy guitars and spectral guest performances with fragments of profound conversations—as if overheard from the night before—resulting in the audio equivalent of subconscious dreamscape. Put simply by Inyang and Reid themselves, Honest Labour is "an album about love and loss." The track "Indigo Grit," for instance, abruptly ends just as the speaker is about to explain the difference between liking and loving someone—a fleeting snippet of wisdom lost just before listeners could grab hold of it. But as with any inquiries into life’s most existential questions, the artists weren't intending to arrive at any conclusions. Through their album, they embraced the sheer mystery of the human experience, remaining at the mercy of their emotions just like the rest of us.—Emeka Okonkwo Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### AceMoMA - A Future (Haus of Altr)
> Haus of AltrAceMoMA - A Future AceMo and MoMA Ready have released a gob-stopping amount of music over the past few years, but their second album together, A Future, really put it all into perspective. The duo work in a well-worn transatlantic tradition, blending drum & bass, jungle and techno, but in their hands it feels cutting-edge as they jump from one tempo to the next with tangible excitement. In spite of its name, the album is the sound of the duo creating a better present, of reimagining Afrofuturist narratives to suit the here-and-now rather than a distant future, of AceMoMA paving the way for everyone around them in New York and beyond.—Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Eris Drew - Quivering In Time (T4T LUV NRG)
> T4T LUV NRGEris Drew - Quivering In Time After conquering the DJing circuit with a mix of psychedelic evangelism and irresistible old-school techno flair, Eris Drew started dipping her toes into production with vibrant results. On her debut album, Quivering In Time, she outdoes herself with nine tracks of club heat packing a festival-sized dose of euphoria into a retro sound palette of tight drum loops, breakbeats and dewy pads. She even includes a sample of psychonaut and ethnobotanist Terence McKenna to drive the point home. House music in 2021 hardly got much more ecstatic than this.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Emeka Ogboh - Beyond The Yellow Haze (A-TON)
> A-TONEmeka Ogboh - Beyond The Yellow Haze Is Beyond The Yellow Haze pretty funky for an art installation? Quite possibly. The original piece catalogs the sounds of bustling Lagos—car horns, traffic, chatter. Those recordings, made into an album for A-TON—Ostgut Ton’s art-forward sublabel—forms the foundation for ghostly broken techno that moves with the start-stop pulse of everyday life in the city. Ogboh's rich, layered atmospherics approximate fog and the motion blur of brake lights on a busy freeway, capturing the vibe of a city in the midst of immense growth, like a moment encased in amber.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Erika de Casier - Sensational (4AD)
> 4ADErika de Casier - Sensational It's difficult to think of any other record this year that united more people from across different electronic music scenes than Sensational. Building on the Danish artist's Y2K R&B obsession and backed with lush yet subdued production from collaborator Central, it is a quiet storm of plucked strings, ornate piano and pitter-patter drums. De Casier's hushed voice alternates between vulnerable and sarcastic, full of biting phrases and memorable one-liners: "You gotta be polite if you wanna roll with me." It’s the kind of music that's made for both memorable dance floor moments and cryptic Instagram captions directed at you-know-who.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### George Riley - interest rates, a tape (Self-released)
> Self-releasedGeorge Riley - interest rates, a tape It's tempting to call George Riley an old soul given her use of R&B vocals over '90s-influenced jazzy breaks, but that wouldn't do justice to her first mixtape, which felt ambitious even at its most relaxed. Her words come out in a stream-of-consciousness blur, revealing and incisive in their casual, say-whatever-comes-to mind-flow ("I don't want any man / Full stop!"). Oliver Palfreyman's beats feel dynamic and fluid, as if tailored to every twist and turn in Riley's sinuous vocal melodies. Dark, uplifting and sometimes even funny, it is one of the most striking R&B debuts of the year—Afrofuturism tuned to a very personal frequency.—A.R. Listen: Spotify / Apple Music

### Hoavi - Invariant (Peak Oil)
> Peak OilHoavi - Invariant With Invariant, Hoavi set a new standard for what you might call ambient jungle. Combining the luxe atmospherics of dub techno, the fidgety pulse of footwork and the acrobatic loop-de-loops of jungle, the Russian producer's album is uncommonly beautiful, blowing minds while soothing them at the same time. You can pick any track at random and find something to obsess over—the breakcore-in-the-clouds of "Dver," the Balearic funk of "Streamline." But the LP is best taken as a whole, a wash of creamy chords and aerodynamic drum programming.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Virtual Dreams: Ambient Explorations In The House & Techno Age, 1993-1997 (MUSIC FROM MEMORY)
> MUSIC FROM MEMORYVirtual Dreams: Ambient Explorations In The House & Techno Age, 1993-1997 Landing at the very end of 2020, when so many of us were deep in another round of lockdowns, Music From Memory's Virtual Dreams compilation was practically made for daydreaming in your bedroom. Bringing together some of the finest downtempo cuts from both lesser-known names like MDA Analog and lesser-known projects from established names (like Move D and Roman Flügel), the compilation creates a half-lidded world where kick drums dreamily float in and out of focus. Virtual Dreams maps a time when the boundaries between electronic music for the club and the living room weren’t totally solidified, occupying a corridor space between the chill-out room and the dance floor. —Henry Ivry. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Various - The Sound Of Limo (Limousine Dream)
> Limousine DreamVarious - The Sound Of Limo Gene On Earth's The Sound of Limo compilation is a roster of the artists du jour of the new minimal scene, providing documentary evidence of a vital corner of the underground while also working surprisingly well as a cohesive album. Each producer gathered here, from Sugar Free to Dyed Soundorom, has their own quirks, but certain throughlines—chunky basslines, swung drums, cascading video game bleeps—define a sub-genre of a sub-genre unto themselves. The music here is club-ready tech house, but the flourishes of fluorescent synth and often wacky melodies make it as whimsical as it is functional.—H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Soundcloud

### Skee Mask - Pool (Ilian Tape)
> Ilian TapeSkee Mask - Pool Clocking in at over an hour and 45 minutes, Pool demanded a commitment to active listening when it dropped. But Skee Mask has always excelled in the album format, and the extended run time allowed him to cover more ground than ever before. Pool takes the plunge into the sui generis cannabis haze of its soundscapes, where Skee Mask put his love of ambient atmosphere and UK dance music into conversation with bits of soulful funk, jazz and some of his fastest tempos yet (Pool went north of the 170 Arctic Circle at points). But, as only Skee Mask can, he creates an immersive and singular trip where genres come second to the textural richness and detail of his soundscapes, which range from danceable to stop-you-in-your-tracks gorgeous—H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / SoundCloud

### Yu Su - Yellow River Blue (bié RECORDS)
> bié RECORDSYu Su - Yellow River Blue Yu Su's steady stream of dance-adjacent 12-inches over the past four years established a dusky and increasingly ornate twist on the Vancouver house sound, but her debut album Yellow River Blue took her somewhere entirely new, both figuratively and literally. The album functions both as a travel diary and love song. It documents a tour through her native China from Qingdao to the far-west city of Xining, recorded in different cities across the country where Yu Su both reconnected with her homeland and found a whole new community of electronic producers she was previously cut off from. The album is appropriately restless and exploratory, as Yu Su charts a path through geography and genres, from slo-mo breakbeat to Krautrock to dubby downtempo. —H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Perila - How Much Time It Is Between You And Me? (Smalltown Supersound)
> Smalltown SupersoundPerila - How Much Time It Is Between You And Me? Aleksandra Zakharenko, alongside similar-minded artists like Ulla and Ben Bondy, makes ambient music that breaks the mold: it's not necessarily intended to bring you solace and definitely won't make an easy soundtrack for any hotel lobbies (or elevators). How Much Time It Is Between You And Me?, is just as unsettling and eerie as it is delicate. The album uses these mixed emotions—as well as touches of post-rock melodrama and angst—to create a liminal state between waking and dreaming held together by Zakharenko's voice, which guides you through labyrinths that can be nightmarish but, just as quickly, morph into luxurious daydreams. —H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Andy Stott - Never The Right Time (Modern Love)
> Modern LoveAndy Stott - Never The Right Time It's been a decade since Andy Stott released the pair of EPs that introduced us to the dubby world of "knackered house." Since then, the UK artist's music has incorporated decaying memories of pop, like a ghostly outline caught in a photograph, through his ongoing collaborations with Alison Skidmore. Never The Right Time polished that rusting patina into Stott's most accessible album to date. "Don't Know How" is, by his standards, nearly bubblegum. This was true across the board on the record—even the abrasive mechanical rain of "Answers" ends with an uplifting, choral melody. Stott hasn’t lost his penchant for darkness, but now he isn’t afraid of contrasting it with bold and bright bursts of colour either.—H.I. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / SoundCloud

### Wanton Witch - Wanton Witch (Stroboscopic Artefacts)
> Stroboscopic ArtefactsWanton Witch - Wanton Witch Stroboscopic Artefacts has been a hub for no-frills experimental techno for more than a decade, modeling itself in the restrained but psychedelic-friendly image of label owner Lucy. Following a year-long hiatus in 2020—after Lucy released a ten-year compilation of sleek dance floor cuts by mostly old guard artists—the label returned with the surprising self-titled LP from Bangkok-based Wanton Witch. The album opens a new chapter for Stroboscopic Artefacts, not only by featuring a queer, trans outsider artist, but by presenting a volatile, rave-adjacent sound palette beyond the label's wheelhouse. Wanton Witch dive-bombes and detonates with apocalyptic thuds and hardstyle drum fills, marking a new and exciting turn for the imprint and for Alegria's blossoming career. —Chloe Lula Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Dawn Richard - Second Line (Merge Records)
> Merge RecordsDawn Richard - Second Line Dawn Richard's sixth album—and first for the indie giant Merge—introduces her Afrofuturist alter ego, the golden, feather-plumed cyborg King Creole, who Richard described as an "assassination of stereotypes." Working Black-rooted genres like bounce and footwork into her usual experimental R&B, Richard balances a sense of play with her core strengths as a vocalist. "Bussifame" explodes with rallying whoops and commanding swagger, "Jacuzzi" aches with crooning sensuality, and "FiveOhFour (a lude)" switches to a braggadocious snarl. In tandem with intimate audio clips of her mother’s musings on love and Louisiana, it is a kaleidoscopic portrait of Richard's inner world and Southern heritage in glossy, florid detail. —Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### L'Rain - Fatigue (Mexican Summer)
> Mexican SummerL'Rain - Fatigue L'Rain's second album meditates on the seismic complexities of a single emotion—grief—and its ability to exhaust and to destabilize, but to also spur personal evolution. Fatigue swoons into a tender revelry, both in terms of L'Rain's purring vocals and her warm, glowing productions, where the jangling piano keys and melancholic punctuation of saxophone dance around grainy sound recordings. It reminds listeners that sadness is so often site-specific. As a born-and-raised Brooklyner, L'Rain's singular blend of jazz, neo soul and ambient bears the heaviness of her urban environs on top of an already bruised psyche. —W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music / Soundcloud

### V/A - Amapiano Now (NTS)
> NTSV/A - Amapiano Now If anything's apparent from the past few years, it's that dance music is inherently political. The most exciting dance music genre in the world at the moment—amapiano—demonstrates this point in a strikingly literal manner. Born in the townships in Gauteng, South Africa, the fledgling post-kwaito genre is the sound of joy in the midst of struggle. Now it's sweeping the globe. Amapiano Now, the 16-track compilation from NTS, is a bluffer's guide to the new South African dance phenomenon. From established acts like Vigro Deep and Gaba Canal to upstarts like Teno Afrika, the Shannen SP and Joe Cotch-curated collection demonstrates the inherent mid-tempo sensuality of amapiano, the thrilling sound of a generation of artists discovering their powerful collective voice. —Matt McDermott Listen: Spotify / Soundcloud

### Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders & The London Symphony Orchestra - Promises (Luaka Bop)
> Luaka BopFloating Points, Pharoah Sanders & The London Symphony Orchestra - Promises Reading over the personnel for Promises, one might expect a grandiose statement—a multigenerational spiritual jazz odyssey for the ages. Instead, Sam Shepherd and the legendary Pharoah Sanders show a staggering knack for subtlety. Building upon a searching motif of four seven-note chords, both Shepherd and Sanders play with extraordinary humility. The careful arrangements serve as a backdrop for Sanders' restrained sax soloing, but the record doesn’t headline one artist over the other. Instead it reaches for an ineffable oneness, the pinnacle of improvised exploration. Each gradual change feels monumental, like the spaced-out synth exploration on "Movement 7" or the Hammond organ passed through a vibrating Leslie speaker on "Movement 8." That Promises holds its own—and even stands out—within one of the most important catalogues in jazz is a remarkable achievement. —M.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### DJ Manny - Signals In My Head (Planet Mu)
> Planet MuDJ Manny - Signals In My Head 2021 was a golden year for footwork. This year, Planet Mu, once responsible for thrusting the Chicago genre onto the international stage in the mid-'10s, put out a trilogy of releases from stalwarts of this syncopated world: Jana Rush, RP Boo and DJ Manny. On Manny's contribution, the veteran Chicago-born, Brooklyn-based artist sought to bring romance to a genre historically known for soundtracking dance battles. If anyone could step up to this challenge, it would be DJ Manny and his smooth production style. Signals In My Head sees him whipping up some of the most airy atmospheres footwork has ever seen. Rosy melodies swirl into delirium while R&B vocals coo, sometimes lustfully and other times longingly, mellowing out its characteristically rougher rhythms and leaving only traces of a harder past.—Kiana Mickles Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Dean Blunt - Black Metal 2 (Rough Trade)
> Rough TradeDean Blunt - Black Metal 2 Dean Blunt has long been an elusive character, quietly releasing oblique albums without liner notes and responding to interview questions in riddles. His entire body of work could be viewed like a museum of intriguing abstract paintings, open to interpretation but always astonishing. His most recent record riffs on its predecessor's Americana themes—heart-tugging strings, whining harmonica, desert rock guitar and somber and occasionally tongue-in-cheek lyrics that allude to loss, betrayal and the white critic's flimsy observations. But with the help of Joanne Robertson's girlish voice, as if brought down straight from heaven, Black Metal 2 emerges as one of Blunt's most approachable records. —K.M.

### Tirzah - Colourgrade (Domino)
> DominoTirzah - Colourgrade If Tirzah's breakout debut album Devotion was beloved for its intimate romantic love songs, the tracks on Colourgrade will be remembered for expanding the definition of what constitutes a love song in the first place. Moving out of the city and giving birth to two children, Tirzah examined other forms of love, like the camaraderie between creative partners or the bond between parent and child. Some tracks here make it difficult to parse whether she is referring to a lover, a relative or an old childhood friend, but the universality of it all makes Colourgrade a record that will age gracefully with repeated listens. Adding to its introspective beauty and warmth, the album is brought to life with grainy production and endearing imperfections (a cough here, incomprehensible whispers there). Charmingly unpolished and grounded in a human need we can all agree on—love—it's an album that encourages listeners to cherish life's smallest, most precious moments. —K.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### HTRK - Rhinestones (N & J Blueberries)
> N & J BlueberriesHTRK - Rhinestones People rarely talk about their favourite "band" anymore. HTRK, the Australian duo comprising Jonnine Standish and Nigel Yang, are one of a handful of groups that inspire this level of dedication in their fans. Their music holds similar qualities to other classic "favourite bands," like The Cure—their songs microcosms of ineffable longing and desolation. On their latest LP Rhinestones, HTRK continue to embrace stripped-down guitars, this time going for a twang and effects palette that evokes the Kodachrome skies of Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas. In the film, the sprawling vistas and stark photography set the stage for a hushed, heartbreaking drama. Here, the sparse guitar and unhurried progressions serve a similar purpose, foregrounding Standish's languid vocals. As usual, deceptively simple lines like"If you wanted to / Hang out with mе during the day," on "Sunlight Feels Like Bee Stings," hit like a brick. —M.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Joy Orbison - still slipping vol. 1 (XL Recordings)
> XL RecordingsJoy Orbison - still slipping vol. 1 Long gone is the Joy Orbison who only makes club bangers. In his place sits a producer whose music is, with every new release, a truer, more vivid expression of not only his ever-broader tastes, but also his life and loves. Building on recent experiments with R&B and downtempo music, still slipping vol. 1 incorporates voice notes from his family—asking Joy how he's doing, making jokes, talking about weed brownies—into a cosy world of tunes that range from sedate garage to hooky, subdued pop. It feels like a Sunday afternoon in Joy's living room: vinyl all over the floor, loved ones popping in and out and talented friends occasionally jumping on the mic, all culminating into a more relaxed look at one of UK dance music's most quietly virtuosic producers.—Carlos Hawthorn Listen: Bandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music

### Mr. Mitch - Lazy (Gobstopper Records)
> Gobstopper RecordsMr. Mitch - Lazy It can take artists years—decades, even—to be able to authentically express themselves through their music. Mr. Mitch said this personal change occurred around the release of his 2017 album, Devout, a vulnerable record inspired by fatherhood. Not coincidentally, it was also the first time his fans had truly embraced his experimentations with slower tempos, ornate instrumentation and song-oriented structures. The Londoner built on this newfound freedom and confidence on this year's Lazy, with 11 tracks packing a range of energies and emotions. There are heart-rending tributes to his own musician father and strong statements about racism and social justice (the title is a reference to stereotypes about Black people), blending not only genres but personal and political messages in a way that could have felt forced and overblown in less accomplished hands. Instead, one feels profoundly moved. —C.H. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Loraine James - Reflection (Hyperdub)
> HyperdubLoraine James - Reflection The late and great Mark Fisher feared that musical ingenuity was being replaced by desperate revivalism in the dying embers of late capitalism. If he was around now, Reflection might soothe those fears. James' mesmerising neo-IDM classic gestures towards dance music or bedroom R&B, only to take sudden detours into terra incognito that eludes categorisation altogether. (Nothing feels more appropriate than the outro being titled "We're Building Something New.") Sludgy, off-kilter kicks thud under pensive chords like some alien life form's interpretation of dance music. At times heartbreaking, at others startlingly vulnerable, James contemplates pandemic-era existentialism, projecting anxieties about the future with a ghostly delivery that feels like inner monologues being broadcast for all to hear: "This is a reflection / Just mine, not yours." —E.O Listen: Bandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music / Soundcloud

### Arushi Jain - Under The Lilac Sky (Leaving Records)
> Leaving RecordsArushi Jain - Under The Lilac Sky Arushi Jain has a buzzy, larger-than-life personality, but you'd hardly know that from her restrained and gentle music. Constantly jumping from project to project, Jain always found solace in Indian classical compositions when feeling overwhelmed, and wanted her own work to channel the same healing qualities. On her second full-length, she captures the evening light in all its ever-changing glory, moving from sunset to darkness. Humming synths and drones conjure the flickering shadows of twilight, while her voice adds bursts of vivid colour. Aimed at instilling a certain kind of intentionality and meditation in its listeners, Under The Lilac Sky is a guaranteed palette cleanser for those seeking clarity or simply enjoying an evening wind-down.—Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Conclave - Conclave (Love Injection)
> Love InjectionConclave - Conclave The self-titled debut from New York ensemble Conclave is a masterful study in rhythmic flexibility. True to their jazz roots, the group of rotating musicians—led by DJ and multi-instrumentalist Cesar Toribio—start the record as improvisational jams before narrowing down a vision and a concept. Their live approach is tangible: several tracks start on simple refrains before morphing into full-bodied flurries of dreamy funk, Afro-Latin percussion and downtempo beats. In homage to the clave (an instrument and rhythmic pattern), Toribio and his players concoct a joyous commemoration of the power of collaboration, unity and the cathartic energy of house music itself.—N.C. Listen: Bandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music / Soundcloud

### Nala Sinephro - Space 1.8 (Warp Records)
> Warp RecordsNala Sinephro - Space 1.8 On her Warp Records debut, London-based harpist and modular synthesist Nala Sinephro creates introspective electronic soundscapes with warm exhortations from the UK jazz new guard (musicians like Nubya Garcia and Eddie Hick). Combining ambient music and spiritual jazz, Space 1.8 lands like a caress, owing to Sinephro's intuitive touch—she knows exactly when to press, linger or just hold still. "While my hands are doing their job, I’m almost sleepwalking," she told The Guardian in a recent interview. Ranging from meditative to pulsating—with an incredible, career-making 17-minute finale—Sinephro's ambitious but effortless compositions comfort and soothe in all the right places. —N.C.

## [2020's Best Albums](https://ra.co/features/3787)
Date: 2020-12-23T12:00:59.000Z

### Various HOA 10-12 Haus Of ALTR 
> 2020's busiest electronic artist might have been Wyatt D. Stevens, AKA MoMa Ready. Beyond the dozen or so records he produced himself (including an LP with AceMo and two solo albums), there were the ten he released on his label, HAUS Of ALTR, three of which were towering achievements in themselves: HOA 10, 11 and 12, compilations of more than 25 tracks each, released in June, July and September, each of them presenting, in their own words, "the future of Black electronic music," the "Vangaurd in the war against white supremacy in electronic music," and a "march toward a future of unabashed Black electronic expression." These 72 tracks show dozens of vital artists from New York and beyond delivering their A-game or something close to it. Together, they form an embarrassment of riches we're still getting through half a year later. Listen: Bandcamp HOA010 / HOA011 / HOA12

### Slikback /// + ///II Self-Released 
> On September 1st, Slikback released ///, a surprise album that, at 30 tracks, doubled the size of the Nairobi artist's catalog in one fell swoop. Three days later, he released another 30-track bundle, ///||. He called them "a reflection of different vibes and emotions that make me... some rough, some gentle, some funny." The energy and artistry of these 60 tracks is stunning. Gqom, trap, noise, ambient, drill, footwork and techno all get tossed into Slikback's musical wood-chipper. Tempos run from around 70 BPM to over 170. Guest appearances range from Polish sound artist Morgiana Hz to the Ugandan MC Swordman Kitala. These albums should not be an easy listen—they clang, groan, shriek and bang, and sneak up on you when you least expect it. But instead of wearing you down, each new track lures you further in. You never know what kind of perfectly sideways groove is lurking around the corner. Listen: Bandcamp /// / Bandcamp /​/​/ II

### KMRU Peel + opaquer Editions Mego + Dagoretti Records 
> It's fitting that 2020 would produce a breakout star from the realms of ambient and field recording. Kenyan artist Joseph Kamaru, AKA KMRU, had been bubbling up already, but in 2020 he seemed to be everywhere, dropping tracks on his Bandcamp, appearing on the excellent Physically Sick 3, and releasing these two stunning LPs (along with a cassette, Jar) that show the incredible breadth of his sound. Appearing on esteemed avant-garde outlet Editions Mego, Peel is a silky abyss of droning soundscapes and spectral field recordings. Opaquer is its adventurous counterpart, with tracks like "Lost Ones" and "Canthenta" having more in common with bass-heavy experimental music than anything you'd typically call ambient. Together, they introduced many of us to an artist whose music is as powerful as it is subtle. Peel: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify opaquer: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Ulla Tumbling Towards A Wall Experiences Ltd 
> It doesn't lull you into a vegitative state, nor evoke a hotel spa lobby via rainforest field recordings. Instead, the side of ambient Ulla conjures on tumbling towards a wall carries you away with the subtlety of a daydream. The Kansas City artist has worn many aesthetic hats over the years, both on previous releases like Append and in projects like Pontiac Streator and the newly minted LOG. Her delicate compositional ear is clearer than ever on this release. Tracks like "stunned suddenly" and "new poem'' create space to think, without trying too hard to relax you. "feeling remembering," "leaves and wish" and "soak" are spotted with melodies and gentle textures—the album is ripe with soothing sounds, but never cluttered with them. You walk away from tumbling towards a wall feeling like the artist has told you something personal, a secret, and a precious one at that, even if you can't say exactly what it is. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### E.M.M.A. Indigo Dream Local Action 
> In the seven years since her debut album, E.M.M.A. has gotten comfortable composing soundtracks and scores—her recent work has found her soundtracking campaigns for luxury fashion houses like Gucci and Chanel. Her affinity towards large-scale, cinematic projects is reflected in the brief 35 minutes that make up Indigo Dream. Swirling '80s synths and club sounds collide on this mesmerizing album, sending us to the zenith of yearnful nostalgia and back again. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Theo Parrish Wuddaji Sound Signature 
> Even within Theo Parrish's catalogue, Wuddaji felt like a monumental entry. After innovating an often-imitated, never-replicated brand of deep house around the turn of the millennium, Wuddaji's eight tracks felt like a new milestone, or a jumping off point for some new, deliriously funky Black dance music. Dense, futuristic tunes like "Hennyweed Buckdance" are interspersed with floor-fillers like "Angry Purple Birds" and "This is For You." Wuddaji came with a map of Idlewild, a once-thriving vacation enclave in Northwestern Michigan that saw the likes of Aretha Franklin and Louis Armstrong performing for Black audiences escaping segregation in St. Louis and Detroit. Wuddaji, like so much of his music, draws from the personal and the historical, musical and otherwise. His deep understanding of the triumphs and injustices of the past—and their impact on the present—is raw material for groundbreaking art. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud / Sound Signature

### BOOF Rebirth Of Gerberdaisy Bubble Tease Communications 
> Maurice Fulton has a lighthearted, often humorous approach to dance music, and it's safe to say that BOOF is his quirkiest project. These records come out once every five years or so, are always named after flowers and feature elementary artwork that looks like it was made in Microsoft Paint (a stretched flower and clashing text). But beneath that exterior is some of the best work the American multi-instrumentalist has ever put out. Rebirth Of Gerberdaisy is no exception. In fact, it's the best BOOF record yet, with the gusto of a talented live band trying to work out as many dance genres as they can: minimal techno, piano house, stomping disco, jazz fusion and deep, soulful grooves. Of course it's not a band you're hearing, just Fulton going crazy on the organ, guitar and keyboards, a one-of-a-kind talent that makes every genre sound like something he invented. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Beatrice Dillon Workaround PAN 
> The idea of the lone genius is appealing, but most great records are the labor of many minds. On Workaround, South London-born artist Beatrice Dillon embraces the collectivity of music-making, weaving together acoustic instrumentation from 12 different collaborators with her software production techniques to create 14 rhythmically complex toe-tappers, all fixed at 150 BPM. Batu brings the hi-hats on "Workaround Six," which are nonchalantly assembled into a beat, while the malevolent thwack of stand-up bass comes courtesy of Swedish jazz musician Petter Eldh. "Workaround Two" has flushed synths and vocals from Laurel Halo. Dillon's catalogue is an advent calendar of distinct treats, containing dub techno abstractions such as 2015's Face A, experimental cassettes like Index Tape For Performance and Two Changes (with Rupert Clervaux). Workaround, galvanized by a crush on UK dance music, is cultivated through the diligent practice of purposeful limitation. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Various Physically Sick 3 Allergy Season 
> At the beginning of July, four months into the pandemic and six weeks into daily protests following the murder of George Floyd by police, Allergy Season and Discwoman dropped Physically Sick 3, a charity compilation that raised money for Equality For Flatbush, an organization fighting police brutality and gentrification that also helped residents of Brooklyn stay safe during COVID-19. Curated by Physical Therapy, Umfang and Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson, the music was exceptional—27 tracks of bold club sounds, plus the odd bit of noise and ambient, from a cast of artists that spanned continents and generations. The series' tradition of what it once called "electronic protest music" had never felt more necessary, and it was inspiring to see electronic artists rising to the occasion so readily. Beyond being some of the best music that came out this year, Physically Sick 3 was a how-to in DIY music activism. Listen: Bandcamp

### Ana Roxanne Because Of A Flower Kranky 
> Ana Roxanne's debut record, ~~~, had ambient fans in the palm of her hand, eagerly awaiting a follow-up. Her sound instantly had its own niche, drawing from New Age, devotional music and drone. Because Of A Flower is a more confident record than her first. It's conceptually provoking and brilliantly executed, full of vulnerability and understated beauty. Her enchanting vocals elevate Because Of A Flower above your typical ambient fare. It's a refined set of songs that seem to fly by and leave you in a different, more serene mood from where you started. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Jonnine Blue Hills Boomkat Editions 
> Many of the most cherished post-punk pop records—Young Marble Giants' Colossal Youth, Gareth Williams & Mary Currie's Flaming Tunes—are scrappy projects held together by spit and glue. Jonnine's Blue Hills fits that bill. Recorded at HTRK member Jonnine Standish's home in the Dandenong Ranges outside Melbourne, the nine-track album was a low-key affair, first released on cassette as part of Boomkat's series of quarantine records, Documenting Sound. But the spare songs, built on less-is-more bass lines and Standish's spectral vocals, punched above their weight with their effortless mix of the mundane and the sublime. "And hey, you're the best thing that I've had / because you want all the things that I have / And when the birds sing / they sing just for you / they live in blue hills," Standish sang, guiding the listener through the small psychodramas of a life lived in lockdown at the edge of the forest. Listen: Boomkat

### Moodymann Taken Away KDJ 
> Maybe you saw Moodymann in the flesh this year. Or caught his residency at Grand Theft Auto's new nightclub, The Music Locker. Most of us weren't so lucky. Instead, we sought consolation in Taken Away, a record so quintessentially Kenny Dixon Jr. it could probably form the basis of a biography. Detroit? Tick. Roller skating? Tick. Track after track of toasty gospel, house and hip-hop, peppered with sultry, sometimes madcap musings from the "most memorable voice in modern dance music"? Obviously. This LP had it all. Behold a masterclass in house music songwriting. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Yves Tumor Heaven To A Tortured Mind Warp Records 
> The highlight of Yves Tumor's show-stopping fourth album is "Kerosene," a collaboration with the singer Diana Gordon that isn't so much a duet as a collision, rising to a churning climax where Gordon's vocals feel like a cross between Dolores O'Riordan and Alanis Morrisette. It's a moment of fireworks on an album that functions like a powder keg, a 21st-century rock opera starring Tumor, flanked by an arsenal of session musicians and armed with oodles of vaporwave-style loops. Here, amid horn sections that rise up like tidal waves and guitar leads that go up against clipped funk samples, Yves Tumor emerges as something like the rock star they've tried to be for years: sexy, alien, suave, and a master of melodies that get stuck in your head. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Shinichi Atobe Yes DDS 
> No one knows much about techno producer Shinichi Atobe. The Saitama-based artist has been releasing albums on DDS for five years now, with the only communication between him and the label typically consisting of no more than a CD with track titles in the mail. Building on the warm housey elements that were the foundation's of 2018's Heat, Yes is chock full of bright melodies, and of course delivered with his trademark hi-fi production standard. There are also a few surprises, too, like the sci-fi synths on "Lake 3," the funk-driven pulse of "Ocean 1" and the Drexciyan touch of "Loop 1." Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Actress Karma & Desire Ninja Tune 
> There's always excitement around an Actress album, but for this year's Karma & Desire, Darren Cunningham and Ninja Tune went the extra mile. There was a prequel mixtape, which included a cryptic teaser tracklist for the album proper. There was a short film and a hotline you could call to hear a track down the phone. For a few days, rumours even spread of a second Actress mixtape, but it turned out to be the work of Dam Voyage. After all that, Karma & Desire had to be good. Cunningham delivered on the build-up and then some. What we got was a more open and fun version of Actress's early sound. The vocalists made the record more accessible. The instrumentals, too, were brighter and clearer. The album experience, its innovative preamble included, was a clear highlight of 2020. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Duval Timothy Help Carrying Colour 
> Duval Timothy's fourth album has a documentary writer's touch. With his piano front-and-center, the LP narrates a journey of healing and navigating the perils of the music industry, primarily drawing on minimalist jazz hooks and immersive sampling. Timothy has a gift for making gems out of the mundane. On Help, spare vocals are distorted and looped into oddball rhythms, while field recordings bring the compositions to life. It's one of those special, emotive albums that says a lot by doing less. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Yaeji What We Drew 우리가 그려왔던 XL Recordings 
> After creating dance floor bangers so universal they had festival crowds sing along with them, Yaeji took a backseat, preferring to collaborate and curate rather than release the long-awaited follow-up to her breakthrough EPs. What We Drew is a candid study of depression and ennui, how to break free from those things, and how to avoid beating yourself up when you do feel bad. The lead single is a tribute to the act of living: "I got hydrating down / I got listening down," she sings. On "Money Can't Buy," her guest Nappy Nina says, "Snuggly and sleepy / These naps come easy" after a verse of braggadoccio. What We Drew makes it clear that Yaeji connects with audiences around the world because she presents life as it is, celebrating the triumph of persevering and just getting the small things down, supported by love not only from others, but for yourself, too. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Jasmine Infiniti BXTCH SLÄP Self-released 
> More than most techno producers, Jasmine Infiniti embodies the euphoric potential of the genre alongside its darker impulses. Take "Downhill," where muddy drums thump beneath bright, neon-streaked synths. The American artist's debut album straddles this divide so well because of Jasmine Infiniti's lived experience as a person on the margins, where nightlife can be a trap as much as an escape. But for every moment of foreboding, there's a glimpse of light, underpinned by an elastic, almost buoyant sense of melody and rhythm, informed by her days in the Bay Area's vogue scene and the taut slap of ballroom music. It's a techno record unlike any other in 2020—heavy and light, ecstatic and paranoid. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Headie One Edna Relentless Records 
> The authorities coming down hard on Black music is nothing new, but the story around UK drill felt different. This time, even hugely influential platforms like YouTube shared in the vilification, removing videos at the request of the police. That was in 2018, which is incredible when you consider how far the genre has come since then. No one better embodies this turnaround than poster boy Headie One, whose excellent debut album, Edna, felt like a watershed moment for UK drill. Here was a #1 record laying bare the glory and despair of gang life in London, told through the eyes of not only its protagonist but a whole cast of rap stars, from local legends (M Huncho, Ivorian Doll) to global icons (Drake). Once again, Black street music, through a combination of grit and pure talent, had silenced its critics and conquered the mainstream. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Track of the year 
> Giggs Straight Murder (Giggs & David) feat. Dave No Bs Music Giggs and Dave, the two big stars of UK rap, couldn't be more different: Giggs is all presence and cheeky punchlines, while Dave is pure lyrical wizardry. Turns out, their styles complement each other. "Straight Murder (Giggs & David)," their second collaboration, showed both rappers at the top of their games, Dave relentless and razor-sharp, Giggs somehow both jovial and vicious. The wordplay is mind-blowing. And let's give a special shout-out to KeyzMusic, the man behind one of the best and most chilling beats of 2020. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud 2020Track of the year India Jordan For You Local Action India Jordan wrote For You to document the process of coming to terms with their queer identity. Taking cues from happy hardcore, drum & bass and house, the record opens with blissful house tracks "I'm Waiting (Just 4 U)" and the title track, recalling the late-night euphoria of last year's DNT STP MY LV. The "you" here refers to Jordan, who has recently come out to the public as non-binary. There's a feeling of triumph that emanates from "For You." The track shows Jordan's knack for chopping and looping vocal samples, this one employing the amorous hook of Change's "You Are My Melody." The loop never gets old, and as satisfying as the final climactic breakdown of the track is, when the familiar hook comes back around, it makes you wonder why it left in the first place. But the vocals aren't all that make the track pop. "For You" is swaddled in an addictive sunny feeling, thanks to funky guitar riffs, seesawing '80s synths and rousing percussion. The track captures the dizzying joy of finding true love—in this case, the love of one's self.

Date: 2019-12-12T17:00:08.000Z

### Kelela & Asmara 
> Kelela & Asmara Aquaphoria Originally aired as part of Warp's NTS takeover, Kelela and Asmara's Warp mixtape feels like a jam session between friends. Asmara sculpts an undulating backing track out of music from Aphex Twin, Suzanne Kraft & Jonny Nash and Kareem Lotfy—artists that have helped define the recent era of ambient music. Kelela's airy, improvised vocals act are the perfect counterpart to Jaco Pastorius' genius bass solo and Iury Lech's emotional washes. They bring this floating, beatless music to an unforgettable climax. Lena Willikens & Vladimir Ivkovic Live: Nuits Sonores 2019 Headlining festival sets don't always work outside the original setting—as with well-timed jokes, you kinda had to be there. But leave it to Lena Willikens and Vladimir Ivkovic to make their three-hour Nuits Sonores odyssey suit nearly any context. It's meditative, weird and, lest we forget the main room dance floor it soundtracked, banging. Filled with the pair's characteristic slower selections, this mix feels like swimming inside a crystal ball. CCL Unsound Podcast 56 CCL called this mix a "regurgitated memory" of their Honcho Campout set, reflecting on the "more twisted hours… before the light had come up." That predawn unpredictability is what's so exciting here. One highlight is their adept pulling back with Codek's "Closer" before diving into a Metalheadz Wax Doctor rush. With these unreal transitions, and touches like the experimental Polish music that bookends the mix (a nod to Unsound) CCL shows the careful craft that sets them apart. Truly Madly GHOSTCAST 006 Ghostcast, a mix series from Berlin's favourite record store on wheels, has only released a few recordings since launching two years ago, but each is a window into a world of deep-digging DJs with exquisite house and techno collections. Truly Madly is one of them. An underground favourite who's steadily gaining recognition outside the world of trainspotters and Discogs geeks, the Londoner's set traverses classic techno, electro and house, cloaked with the same spacey charm that colours his club sets. Boards Of Canada Societas x Tape (NTS x Warp 30) Boards Of Canada are two of the most reclusive artists in electronic music, which means we don't know much about what they listen to during long stays in the Scottish countryside. Their Societas x Tape mix, a two-hour set broadcast on NTS as part of Warp's 30th anniversary, gives us an idea. Obscure electronics by Filmmaker, '80s post-punk by Killing Joke and synth-pop from Severed Heads tell us a little bit more about these pioneers. Dee Diggs FACT Mix 710 New York's Dee Diggs is on a quest to remind everyone that dance music is black music. Her FACT mix is her fiery mission statement, cutting through the history of black dance music, from Paris Is Burning and vintage acts like DJ Deeon and Karizma to NYC's new guard, including upstarts like Devoye and AceMo. This mix is classic, soulful and banging in all the right places, securing Diggs' own place in the canon she's charting. Eris Drew Raving Disco Breaks Vol. 1 On this year's funkiest mixtape, Eris Drew made some of dance music's most classic sounds her own. Raving Disco Breaks is composed of dance classics chopped into breaks on-the-fly by the American DJ, showcasing not only her impressive technical skills but also the emotional, spiritual and often nostalgic flair that makes her sets so electrifying. It's old-school technique with a new-school vibe. Francesco Del Garda Robert Johnson Archive 0002 Francesco Del Garda played this set at Robert Johnson on the banks of the Rhine a few days after Christmas last year. He couldn't have asked for a better setting: sun rising, perfect soundsystem, six-hour time slot, festive crowd. This recording, an edition of the Frankfurt club's new mix series, gives us only an hour of it, but it shows Del Garda on fire, indulging the uplifting sound that distinguishes him from his contemporaries. Batu Truancy Volume 240 Batu describes his Truancy mix as the closing set for a "festival in 2030 called Bristol-Bass." Given his Timedance label and his own inventive productions, he's in a good position to imagine the future of UK dance music. The mix’s backbone wiggles and booms with modern bass music, while making adventurous jumps from Latin and Afro-Caribbean rhythms to ambient techno and experimental club. Erika IT.podcast.s08e01 Erika's Interdimensional Transmissions podcast from March really lives up to the Detroit label's name: it sounds like you're hearing an actual transmission from another dimension. IT does down-the-rabbithole techno better than anyone, and this recording of Erika at an LA showcase for sister label Eye Teeth shows the sound at its cosmic, funky, head-spinning best. DJ Persuasion Dedicated To The Dedicated 94-95 Ask any junglist worth their salt: 1994 and '95 were the golden years. Disagree? Well, you might feel differently after listening to Dedicated To The Dedicated 94-95, the latest hour-long mix by '90s dance music fanatic DJ Persuasion, AKA Semtek. Every tune, most of them near-impossible to track down, writhes with rhythm and soul. The warm basslines and time-stretched vocals spark tingles of euphoria. When people say the '90s were better, this is the kind of thing they're thinking of. Sherelle LDN: Bass & Percs Special Earlier this year, Sherelle's debut Boiler Room session—a whirlwind of footwork, jungle and grime—went viral. While it's easy for some high BPM DJs to tire out their audience, her set maintains an addictive high energy throughout, with explosive, playful transitions that sparked the dance music equivalent of a mosh pit. Wait for the gutsy rewind at 23:40 that shot her to instant (and deserved) fame. Leif Freerotation 2019 Leif is part of a small group of DJs whose yearly sets at Freerotation festival in Wales always feel like a big deal. 2019 was no exception. In this recording, Leif redefines the peak-time set, starting slow and spindly before moving gracefully through many shades of cosy, rhythmic club music. There are tunes by Equiknoxx and Domu, Efdemin and Aphex Twin, all stitched together with extraordinary skill. As one SoundCloud commenter put it: "are you even human." Dr. Rubinstein Phonica Mix Series 56 Dr. Rubinstein is like an acid historian, wading through decades of dance music history to find the best 303 lines ever put to wax. Yet she still finds time in her Phonica mix to highlight several up-and-coming talents (Jack Roland, Gian) alongside more familiar names (DMX Krew, Adapta). Sometimes dark, sometimes bright, Phonica Mix Series 56 was a deeply psychedelic trip, weaving excellent electro and techno between forgotten acid bombs. As always with Rubinstein, the mixing was world-class, each transition bringing us further into her unique sound world. Leon Vynehall DJ-Kicks Last year, Leon Vynehall released Nothing Is Still, showing the world that his production chops extended way beyond the club. In 2019 he did something similar, but with DJing. His proof this time is a spellbinding DJ-Kicks mix, which blends genres, eras and moods together with sublime flow and dexterity. Dancehall, techno, pop, jungle, soul, a solo piano piece—what could've been a hot mess ends up as one of the classiest mix CDs in recent memory. re:ni Dekmantel Podcast 253 re:ni's Dekmantel podcast does everything right. The tracklist left the sleuths at mixesdb mostly stumped. The mixing is inspired, moving swiftly through tempos and styles with quick sleights of hand and extended blends. More than anything, though, its re:ni's ineffable sense of groove—slinky, fluid, always in flux—that makes this one really pop off. Turtle Bugg HNYPOT 330: African Art of Acid (Triple A Baybee) Mixx Turtle Bugg's Honey Soundsystem mix makes a point so simple it often goes unsaid: black people invented acid house. And yet, as he puts it, "There was no Second Summer Of Love in Amerikkka, no Ibiza for Negroes to spend their holiday, no beginnings of a multi-million dollar industry that could change the lives of Lady Liberty's bastard children." The voices of Dave Chappelle, Malcolm X and Derrick May ring out over interlocking acid lines. The message is clear: black ingenuity thrives, no matter who is paying attention. Ben UFO Hessle Audio - 9th September 2019 What makes this Hessle Audio show, one of many hosted by Ben UFO in 2019, so special? Well, it just is. On that early autumn night, armed with a stack of fresh wax, the UK DJ was on particularly impressive form, treating regulars and first-timer listeners to a beautifully woven tapestry of ambient, Afro techno, jungle and Joe. When it aired, it wasn't just nerds and ravers listening, either—Four Tet, Hunee, John Talabot and other dance music dons had all tuned in for their weekly dose of musical inspiration. Via App Crack Mix 307 Via App taps into the elemental energy of Brooklyn's techno underground on this mix for Crack, a set as volatile as any of their recent productions. This bumpy ride through jarring turns and interruptions, with its snarling, punkish spirit, hit harder than most other mixes we heard this year. <a href="/reviews/23502">Powder In Space by Powder</a> Powder Powder In Space You play Powder In Space once. You think, "This is nice." You leave it for a while, then play it a second and third time. You notice things like the Roy Brooks vocal, or Daphne's bubbling vibraphone melody, that you didn't catch the first time. You also realize you've fallen in love with it. This is how Powder's mix gets under your skin: her unobtrusive approach, drawn from offbeat house with gorgeous textures, waits for you to come around to it. Shannen SP DISCWOMAN 80 Alongside Kode9, Shannen SP runs Hyperdub's Ø events at London's Corsica Studios, a wonderful monthly midweek showcase of experimental music and art. She's quickly become a DJ to watch, and this mix for Discwoman showcases her knack for linking together sharp, angular beats with loose percussive rhythms—a style she sums up as "witchy black energy." Ciel FACT Mix 724 Cindy Li's FACT mix has a specific concept: "fast & light," inspired by hummingbirds. It also captures what makes her DJing so dynamic. The Toronto artist makes breakbeat, electro and techno float like feathers on the breeze, moving through quick-footed drum patterns and fluttering melodies with finesse. Her technique changes the feel of the music itself, which is among the highest compliments you can pay a DJ. Physical Therapy Live: Honcho Campout 2019 The Way In may have had the freakiest sounds at this year's Honcho Campout. Hours before CCL brought the dance floor to tears with Beat Happening, Physical Therapy unfurled this masterclass in trippy eclecticism. Cuts of perfectly dreamy drum & bass, a slo-mo version of Cece Peniston's "Finally" layered over Stenny’s "Stress Test," Andrew Weatherall's remix of St Etienne, D'Angelo's "Devil's Pie"—the highlights in this one are simply too many to name. From a punter's perspective, hearing a DJ with such unique style going for it like this is basically as good as it gets. Josey Rebelle Essential Mix "The thread that runs through the music I play, and my whole life, comes from my parent's generation," Josey Rebelle told us in 2017's Real Scenes: London film. Her parents are part of the Windrush generation, which arrived in the UK from the Caribbean in the 1950s and went on to make an inestimable impact on British life and culture. Rebelle's heritage pours out the speakers every time she's behind the decks. She's a quintessential London DJ: informed by the city's record shop and soundsystem culture, she's comfortable weaving together soul, techno, house, disco, R&B and jungle. Her first Essential Mix was dark and funky, with deep US music from Jamal Moss and Aybee featuring alongside London favourites Steven Julien and Cooly G. Ariel Zetina Truancy Volume 249 "Power to them sexy transsexuals out there, transforming the world," a woman intones in the opening moments of Ariel Zetina’s Truancy mix. It's one of many vivid vocal samples that contribute to the smartbar resident's sense of narrative. Beneath them, trippy acid house and soulful techno—much of it produced by other queer and trans artists—paint different moods. Sometimes it's raw and sexy, other times meditative and strange, but always charged with attitude and passion. Jackie House HNYPOT 300: Half A Bar Will Do It Jackie House's "Half A Bar Will Do It" mix came out 11 months ago, in that post-New Year's, deep-winter stretch of time when dance music in the Northern Hemisphere briefly goes into hibernation. It matches that mood perfectly, easing, over the course of three hours, through soothing, low-energy grooves of all kinds, from Kompakt deep cuts to ambient jungle pitched way, way down. Jackie's photo—swaddled in blankets, bathed in warm lamplight—shows the best way to take this one in. Nosedrip Live: Dekmantel Festival 2019 It's one thing to play a bunch of psychedelic dub and obscure post-punk on the radio. It's something else entirely to mix it at a festival and hold the dance floor. That's what Nosedrip did on the Red Light Radio stage at Dekmantel this summer. Luckily, we now have the recording to pogo to. In the STROOM head's hands, a rare Belgian cut like Siglo XX's "Individuality" becomes a statement of purpose: "I don't wanna be like the others / I am an originality / In search for individuality." Sybil Jason Blowing Up The Workshop 103 Sybil Jason's Blowing Up The Workshop mix is only 40 minutes long and it ends abruptly after a particularly satisfying transition. Showcasing her range, this quick, intense and blindsiding mix ranges from weirdo downtempo to synth-pop to techno, as Jason jumps between eras like a skilled time traveler. She had a bigger year than ever in 2019, and it's DJing skills like this that got her there. Spekki Webu Nous'klaer Radio #20 Though trance has been bubbling up again in dance music for a few years now, in 2019 it took centre-stage. While some turned to Eurodance for inspiration, Spekki Webu sought out the throb of the genre's earlier psychedelic forms. This precise set for Nous'klaer Audio is a masterclass in otherworldly DJing, journeying into hallucinogenic, hypnagogic soundscapes before it melts into the ether.

### Eris Drew 
> Eris Drew Raving Disco Breaks Vol. 1 On this year's funkiest mixtape, Eris Drew made some of dance music's most classic sounds her own. Raving Disco Breaks is composed of dance classics chopped into breaks on-the-fly by the American DJ, showcasing not only her impressive technical skills but also the emotional, spiritual and often nostalgic flair that makes her sets so electrifying. It's old-school technique with a new-school vibe.
