### October 2025: Albums 

### **XL Recordings** - keiyaA – hooke's law (XL Recordings)
> XL Recordings keiyaA – hooke's law Bad blood. Depression. Snide landlords. And then there's all the fun in between. Written during a time of deep self-reflection, hooke's law follows keiyaA as she tears everything and everyone up only to emerge more invigorated than ever. Following her beloved debut album, these 19 tracks are a remarkable crossover between R&B, ambient and the kind of experimental music you might expect from genre-adverse producers like Klein and DJ Haram. Soulful and sexy, scornful and weird, the album charts an explosive period of emotional growth. Read the full review Listen: Bandcamp Bad blood. Depression. Snide landlords.

### **Self-Released** - DJ SWISHA – FIRST HAND SMOKE (Self-Released)
> Self-Released DJ SWISHA – FIRST HAND SMOKE On his debut album, New York club king DJ SWISHA samples house, R&B and pop, folding his encyclopedic music knowledge into a pointedly North American package. Here, Baltimore club meets Jersey club, and footwork and juke beats rearrange the soulful molecules of R&B. There's nothing quite as earth shattering as "CLUB MEGAMIXXX" (RA's best track of 2023), but these are dance floor tools refined for the album format, meaning there's plenty of living-room listenability.

> Hakuna Kalula DJ Babatr – Root Echoes Carefully selected from more than 700 archived works made between 2003 and 2007, Root Echoes documents raptor house at its subversive peak. With each sweaty, speeding track, DJ Babatr redefines the genre with a watertight mission: amplifying Afro-Venezuelan voices.

### **Rush Hour** - Various – Techno Kayō Vol. 1 - Japanese Techno Pop 1981 - 1989 (Compiled by Dubby & Antal) (Rush Hour)
> Rush Hour Various – Techno Kayō Vol. 1 - Japanese Techno Pop 1981 - 1989 (Compiled by Dubby & Antal) Dubby, one of the curators of Japanese Techno Pop 1981 - 1989, recently told Magazine Sixty that techno pop has a "rather cheesy and slightly tacky image" in Japan. This compilation aims to correct that narrative—and how. Focusing on the genre's niche and experimental branches, it takes listeners from the cosmic funk of TPO and Linda's "Rock The Hour" to the leftfield sound collage of Kazuo Ohtani's "Last Battle."

### **XL Recordings** - Blawan – SickElixir (XL Recordings)
> XL Recordings Blawan – SickElixir These 14 brutal tracks judder from industrial hip-hop to syncopated sludge, redefining what a techno LP can be. But what really gives this record its otherworldly feel is Blawan's voice. Twisted into a monstrous rasp through layers of filters, it's the first thing we hear and it holds everything together from there on out.

### **Modern Love** - Carrier – Rhythm Immortal (Modern Love)
> Modern Love Carrier – Rhythm Immortal As a producer, Carrier specialises in white space. On Rhythm Immortal, the UK artist's use of percussion is the centrepiece, but the gaps he leaves in between the beats are the most compelling. Dub techno, ambient, industrial and jazz motifs unite in perfect harmony. Just listen to "Offshore," where slithering synths and hiccuping drums are tempered by saxophone and piano chords that gleam quietly like little spots of sun.

### **Hood Rave** - Various – Rhythm 2 Revolt Solidarity Compilation (Hood Rave)
> Hood Rave Various – Rhythm 2 Revolt Solidarity Compilation BAE BAE's Hood Rave party is one of Los Angeles' best. Why? Because of its outspoken commitment to liberation. The platform's first compilation splits proceeds between the Gaza Mutual Aid Solidarity Fund and NDLON's Immigrant Defense Fund, featuring songs that skitter between ambient, techno and East Coast club. Daniel Pineda's "Do Something" captures the sense of urgency underlining both politics and dance floors right now. Note the blaring siren, club breaks and a voice echoing, "Do something to stop the killing." Listen: Bandcamp BAE BAE's Hood Rave party is one of Los Angeles' best. Why?

### **STROOM.TV** - Felicity J Lord – FJL (STROOM.TV)
> STROOM.TV Felicity J Lord – FJL Although technically released in late September, this album is catnip for fans of Voice Actor, Klein and Dean Blunt. A 26-track LP might seem like overkill these days, but FJL's vignettes are made for the ADD generation. These short songs loop familiar pop and R&B samples—cozy and familiar playgrounds from which emerge the most chaotic spoken word you'll hear on a record this year.

### **Kou Records** - Charmaine Lee – Tulpa (Kou Records)
> Kou Records Charmaine Lee – Tulpa This is the kind of record that will deeply satisfy experimental music enthusiasts who wait patiently every year for cutting-edge festivals like Unsound and Dripping. The New York artist's dark ambient soundscapes blanket intense, complex vocal processing that turns quick breaths, hums and tongue clicks into shuddering rhythms.

### **LATINCORE** - CRRDR – LATINCORE LEGEND (LATINCORE)
> LATINCORE CRRDR – LATINCORE LEGEND Bogotá's CRRDR doesn't take his title of "Latincore legend" lightly. The genre he champions takes the speeding BPMs and blistering intensity of hardstyle, blending it with guaracha, reggaeton and dembow. Throughout his debut album, bachata meets Jersey club ("Te Gusta Mi Bachata"), Eurodance fuses with guaracha ("Oh Baby") and IDM synths glimmer over a reggaeton beat. Tapping vocalists from Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and Chile, this a sublime representation of the Latincore movement.

> Somewhere Press Dania – Listless Smoky drums, slushy guitar and a delicate voice that whispers through the darkness.

> Hessle Audio Jasmín – Bite The Hand That Feeds You On her first fully fledged record—and Hessle Audio's 50th release—Jasmín continues to explore the label's techno-dubstep roots.

### **Tectonic Recordings** - Beatrice M. – Midnight Swim (Tectonic Recordings)
> Tectonic Recordings Beatrice M. – Midnight Swim Another hit from an artist who can't stop making them. Rippling from dubstep to dub techno, Beatrice M. creates tracks with the quiet dynamism and depth of an ocean. It's so detailed that it's less of a soundscape than an entire new world of slippery bass and minuscule sounds, urging you to climb inside.

### **Moveltraxx** - Qemist – The New Juke Tape (Moveltraxx)
> Moveltraxx Qemist – The New Juke Tape Juke and footwork were born in Chicago but they maintain a strong grip beyond the Midwest. Based out of Memphis, Tennessee, Qemist takes these genres and puts them into a blender, resulting in a high-BPM fusion of unwieldy, banging East Coast club, jungle and R&B.

### **Good Morning Tapes** - Full Circle – Beyond Knowhere (Good Morning Tapes)
> Good Morning Tapes Full Circle – Beyond Knowhere Following a corrective Goa trance compilation aiming to give the Indian-born psychedelic dance sound its flowers, Parisian duo Full Circle continue their focus on the misunderstood genre on Beyond Knowhere. This is progressive house indebted to the psychedelia of Goa trance, featuring plenty of reverbed sitar and detailed acid. "Painting Noise" even has a trip-hop chug.

### **Tratratrax** - De Grandi – Testa Dura (Tratratrax)
> Tratratrax De Grandi – Testa Dura This full-throttle EP takes cues from dubstep, techno and club music, looping twisty, squelchy basslines and heaving drums to explosive effect. The record flies out the traps: the opening title track plows through a monstrous bassline and quick-fire drums. The remixes do the blistering tunes justice, with Call Super and Parris bringing a quirky, drum-forward house touch on their "Yeah But Still" version.

### **Reclaim Your City** - Wata Igarashi, Polygonia – Cross Passage (Reclaim Your City)
> Reclaim Your City Wata Igarashi, Polygonia – Cross Passage Polygonia and Wata Igarashi approach hypnotic ecstasy from different angles: the former goes for blissed-out baubles; the latter embraces the growl of blazing arpeggios. On their latest collaborative EP, you can hear Polygonia's melodic brightness, while the grimey deepness sounds like the handiwork of Igarashi.

Moving through hits, deep cuts and collaborations, this two-hour mix celebrates an artist who was forever chasing the divine through groove, analogue grit and a one-of-a-kind lyricism.

Rooted in a deep love of Black diasporic music, she moves from dubstep to hip-hop, drifting from Commodo and Daweh Congo to Bahamadia and Minnie Riperton. According to one RA staffer on the dance floor, there were "tears everywhere" and a voice periodically yelling, "What the fuck, Mia?!"

### Sugar Free at Selectors - Dekmantel 2025

### Live At Dripping 
> Succubass Live At Dripping Seattle's Succubass is a pillar of the US DIY underground, and for their Friday night set at Dripping, they turned The Barn into a fever dream of bass and distortion. Moving from Zvvra's tactile techno and the dub of Gil.Barte to the heady steppers of Commodo & Gantz, Succubass stitches together something raw, cinematic and deeply physical. Each drop makes it feel like the music was testing the limits of the small room.

### MNMT 488 
> Andy Martin MNMT 488 Listen to any set from Kia, Priori or Cousin and you'll likely hear the dubbed out productions of Mexican-Jamaican producer Andy Martin. Based in Guadalajara, he has become a quiet force in the global underground, uniting sci-fi techno with the rhythmic sensibilities of the Caribbean and Latin America. For Norway's Monument Festival, he delivers a transportive set that moves from the weightless dub pressure of Bukkha and Abstract Man into sleek, hypnotic techno from Oscar Mulero and Unbalance.

### IT.podcast.s14e07 
> Scott Zacharias IT.podcast.s14e07 Scott Zacharias has long been one of Detroit's best-kept secrets. His singular, offbeat taste has made his No Way Back sets the stuff of legend. This year's closing in the Outer Space Room was among his most personal yet—as Zacharias recounts in the description, his partner joined him on-stage at the end of the set to celebrate her pregnancy. Anchored by the spirit of Arthur Russell's "In The Light Of The Miracle," the set drifts through everything from cosmic dub and art-pop melancholia to ambient techno and ecstatic house over the course of five hours.

### Making Time 2025 
> K Wata Making Time 2025 As cofounder of experimental label SLINK, K Wata has become one of New York's most exciting new producers, known for slinky micro-dubs and bass music that messes with perception. His set from this year's Making Time ∞ follows that same thread: psychedelic, dubstep-adjacent and full of pressure, threading tracks from Deadbeat, Wata Igarashi and Paleman into something that feels somehow both heavy and weightless. It's club music that breathes, flexes and rearranges the air around you.

### September 2025: Albums 

### **YEAR0001** - Malibu – Vanities (YEAR0001)
> YEAR0001 Malibu – Vanities French electronic artist Malibu is known for her transcendental performances. When paired with white beams of light that circle her audience, her wordless live sets become deeply surreal. Vanities, her filmic debut album, aims to transport you to that otherworldly state. While it draws from the soothing chords and glittery instrumentation of New Age and baroque music, the silvery pop melodies steal the show. This is weighty, elegant ambient that should be listened to with a proper sub, so that its immersive waves of sound envelop you.

### **Scenic Route** - Acopia – Blush Response (Scenic Route)
> Scenic Route Acopia – Blush Response Rich with shoegazey guitars, simmering electronica and frontwoman Kate Durman's most plaintive vocals to date, Blush Response luxuriates in rock elements that lingered in the margins of previous Acopia albums. The rawness of the instrumentation, peppered with tiny textural details, distinguishes this LP from the group's signature dream pop. By unpixelating their previous sound, Acopia reach the perfect balance between gut-wrenching drama and understated surrender.

### **AD 93** - james K – Friend (AD 93)
> AD 93 james K – Friend On her hotly anticipated new LP, Friend, james K sets herself loose inside a carefully constructed assemblage of drum & bass, trip-hop and shoegaze, carving offbeat shapes from the contemporary resurgence of all three genres. The album is crisper, cleaner and more complex than any of her back catalogue, drawing from crystalline pop and rock while maintaining her characteristic enigma. Full of lush, expansive pads and skittering microbeats, these songs sound like half-remembered dreams.

### **AD 93** - Joanne Robertson – Blurrr (AD 93)
> AD 93 Joanne Robertson – Blurrr Joanne Robertson is widely known for her vocal cameos on records by Dean Blunt and Elias Rønnenfelt. But her latest solo album, Blurrr, establishes her as an artist in her own right. Written in between painting sessions and caring for her toddler, the gorgeous LP features drumless guitar ballads alongside contributions from cellist Oliver Coates. Most arresting, though, are the moods she conveys. Achieving a compositional yin-yang, she somehow scores both the euphoria of depression and the grief of joy.

### **Scorpio Red** - Kelman Duran – Scorpio Falling (Scorpio Red)
> Scorpio Red Kelman Duran – Scorpio Falling Dembow experimentalist Kelman Duran makes shadowy music that conjures scenes of sodden tunnel paths at nightfall. Beneath his shrouded pads are distinctly Caribbean sounds, like dancehall and reggaeton. Scorpio Falling, his first album since 2021's Night In Tijuana, is a gritty journey through jazz, Memphis rap and dark ambient with spurts of spritely dembow breaking the meditative lull.

> TAR / MM / UOH Titanic – HAGEN Titanic, the avant-garde project from producer and guitarist I. la Católica and cellist Mabe Fratti, returns with punkish elegance on HAGEN. The chords are brighter, Fratti's vocals more dynamic and the ascendent alternative pop swells to new heights.

### **RVNG Intl.** - Lucrecia Dalt – A Danger To Ourselves (RVNG Intl.)
> RVNG Intl. Lucrecia Dalt – A Danger To Ourselves The past few years have been intense for Lucrecia Dalt. The Colombian artist has experienced several seizures and an eight-second stop to her heart since her last album, ¡Ay!. She also fell head over heels in love. Her latest alt-pop album, A Danger To Ourselves, is full-on haunting, as she whispers through a hall of tip-toeing cello and guitar plucks. Tracks like "stelliformia" carry the immersive lyricism that you'll want to listen to alone in your room. A Danger To Ourselves bristles with the kind of eerie love poems that only Dalt could write.

### **ERF** - YS – Burn (ERF)

### Unsound Podcast 107: DJ E / Chuquimamani-Condori 
> DJ E / Chuquimamani-Condori Unsound Podcast 107: DJ E / Chuquimamani-Condori First tested at the opening of last year's Unsound in Kraków, this mix captures the singular, hyper-charged style that has made Chuquimamani-Condori (AKA DJ E) one of electronic music's most unpredictable forces. It feels like a dispatch from an oasis far removed from the parameters of experimental music as we know it. Across 48 minutes, Andean folk, cumbia and country music are bent and spliced into a delirious wall of sound, stitched together with the Bolivian-American artist's signature soundboard FX.

Emerging from Durban's townships in the early 2010s, gqom quickly became one of South Africa's most influential party genres, defined by heavy bass, stripped-back percussion and a brooding intensity.

### In Focus: DJ Medhi (mixed by Antonine Scali) 
> DJ Mehdi, Antoine Scali In Focus: DJ Medhi (mixed by Antonine Scali) NTS Radio's latest In Focus celebrates DJ Mehdi, a hip-hop-kid-turned-house-DJ who defined a generation of Paris nightlife in the early 2000s. Raised on the outskirts of the French capital by Tunisian parents, he began producing mixtapes and beats inspired by J Dilla, before emerging as an unlikely icon of the Paris party scene. His radiant selections helped stitch together disparate worlds, from Daft Punk and Justice to MC Solaar. This hour-long mix captures that alchemy: rugged, sample-heavy productions for 113, Rohff and Mafia K'1 Fry sit alongside glossy, synth-driven anthems like "Pocket Piano," culminating in the euphoric climax of Thomas Bangalter's edit of "Signatune."

While the Danish city has in recent years become known for high-BPM techno, Mbizo carves out a different path, grounding his set in old-school steppers, digi-dub and meaty dubstep (listen out for the cheeky JME edit). It's a refreshing counterpoint—and a seriously impressive showcase of Mbizo's studio skills.

Her blend of pitch-shifted, syncopated spoken-word, fluttering hums and lo-fi glitch FX evokes the boundless jazz fusions of artists like duendita and keiyaA.

### **Planet Mu** - Slikback – Attrition (Planet Mu)
> Planet Mu Slikback – Attrition Attrition, Slikback's first album on Planet Mu, explores themes of transition and reflection. Written during a relocation to Poland and the expectant arrival of the musician's first child, it's his most mature and realised work to date. The drums strike first. Violent and chaotic, his mutant programming often feels like he's flipping through a rolodex of trap and hard dance sub-genres at an accelerating pace. And yet, the LP's softer moments are among its most compelling. Read the full review Listen: Bandcamp Attrition, Slikback's first album on Planet Mu, explores themes of transition and reflection.

### **Artificial Pinearch Manufacturing** - Stars of the Lid – Music for Nitrous Oxide (Artificial Pinearch Manufacturing)
> Artificial Pinearch Manufacturing Stars of the Lid – Music for Nitrous Oxide Stars of the Lid's 1995 debut album is regarded as a classic within the ambient and drone world for a reason. The record is dense enough to wrap around and colour an environment, but never too imposing. This 30th-anniversary reissue highlights the pioneering drone duo's staying power. The smudged guitar flickers on "Down" gently speak to the current moment. In the era of Spotify's anodyne functionality playlists, the majesty of a slowly undulating drone piece like "Goodnight" feels like a brilliantly comical riposte to the idea of easy-listening music. But those subtle challenges have guided Stars of the Lid from the beginning.

This year alone has seen pop divas like FKA twigs and Addison Rae summon its spirit both reverentially and referentially.

### **Young** - Two Shell – IIcons (Young)
> Young Two Shell – IIcons On IIcons, anonymous trickster duo Two Shell find a happy medium between their newer hyperpop-influenced sound and the UK bass that defined their early career as producers on Livity Sound. The album (likely named in reference to their 2022 EP, Icons) swings from poles with an almost comical severity. "beeep" sounds straight out of the London underground, lurching forward with skippy drum programming and blustering sub-bass, while "w a k e u p" pulls from Eurodance, all chintzy synths and zooming melodies.

### **Icelab** - Sugar Free – Disociando (Icelab)
> Icelab Sugar Free – Disociando Sugar Free's debut EP mirrors her provocative DJing style. Borrowing from prog house, electro-soldered techno and '80s sleaze, Disociando is one of the year's best club 12-inches. Its darkness is most palpable on the B-side. "Vale" starts with skippy, Perlon-style drum programming, only to morph into the claustrophobic techno that's become synonymous with the Montevideo scene. "Mentalizate" merges DJ Nobu's psychedelia with contemporary minimal. It feels weightless, as if you've entered a gravity-free chamber.

He brought it to life with alter ego MC Boing, whose high-pitched voice bore a striking resemblance to the CGI-animated Crazy Frog. He's since worked with real-life artists such as Caroline Polachek, Oklou and now PinkPantheress. Opening with ominous choral pads, "Starlight" makes use of PinkPantheress's saccharine, Auto-Tuned vocals, creating a misty atmosphere amid the relentless energy.

It doesn't take long to deduce that the pop auteur's new single, "Perfectly," is an alternate version of album cut "Perfect Stranger." The charging chords of the original are underpinned by a torrent of techno kick drums, turning the garage pop song into the kind of track that would fill a concrete dance floor at your favourite rave.

Water droplets flood piano plinks ("Spiraling P.M.") and the sound of tape unraveling hisses through clattering instruments ("Sanguis Stilla"). Moments of quiet are eventually uprooted, unveiling the chaos lurking underneath.

> Self-Released tiro! – Mountain Loop // Forest Loop EP tiro! was gifted with a fascinating ear for loops. His music is bubbly and life-affirming, carrying the laid-back groove of second-generation Chicago house even though he's based on the other side of the world in Johannesburg. "Went on a hike and got inspired," he shares on the two-track EP's liner notes. The lush, repetitive churn of life experienced on those nature walks are all over this record, from the sunny synths on "Forest Loop" to the melody on "Mountain Loop," which flies between flangered chords and woody percussion.

This EP's opener, "Fast Forward," marks a noticeable shift in energy level, with a glitchy drum pattern and revved-up acidline. "Classless Act" tempers the A-side's peak-time palette, grooving to a restful pace with dubby pads and chirpy house drums.

> Neffa-T 8 Deck Technical Mix Neffa-T's 8 Deck Technical Mix is a stunning showcase of the continued potential of mixing records. Never one to rest on his laurels, the CDJ wizard's latest filmed session is 80 minutes of jaw-dropping skill. More than just a numbers stunt, his use of eight decks and two mixers allows for razor-sharp cuts and the spontaneous recomposition of tracks in real time, blurring the line between DJing and live performance. Almost constantly moving, it's as transfixing to watch as it is to listen to. Much like Jeff Mills' seminal Exhibitionist series, this is a vulnerable, high-wire act of solo mastery that will be talked about for years. Just remember the popcorn.

### Hessle Audio - 30 June 2025 
> Dave Huismans (AKA A Made Up Sound) Hessle Audio - 30 June 2025 "It's experimental music that people have to move to." So said Ben UFO back in 2016 when reflecting on A Made Up Sound's unique appeal. For a decade, the musician's catalogue was home to a wild alchemy of sounds—take "Afterhours," a lurching, 12-minute hybrid of dubstep and Detroit techno—that inspired total awe in his contemporaries. Though the Dutch producer has kept a low profile in recent years, his latest project, ex_libris, proves that his guiding ethos of innovation has only deepened. His two-hour Hessle Audio takeover, which explores a range of personal favourites and early influences (Mary J. Blige, Krust), is a markedly intimate offering from an artist who's long thrived on bending boundaries in every direction. "It's experimental music that people have to move to."

Her ability to infuse eccentric elements into dance music is particularly unique—breaky techno suddenly morphs into ghostly drone; sombre organ notes give way to zany synth patterns. In her hands, anything and everything is possible. Last month, after travelling stateside on a ship, Nono Gigsta made a stunning debut at Dripping.

### Good Work – 12 July 2025 
> Loidis Good Work – 12 July 2025 Loidis has an uncanny ear for deep tech house gems, the kind with slippery grooves, punchy synths and foggy dub rhythms. These delightfully minimal cuts form the bulk of this four-hour set at Brooklyn's Good Work. The Kansas native, AKA Huerco S., has plenty to show off, never lingering on one strain of tech house for too long. His style goes way beyond traditional mnml (though there's plenty of that in here too), incorporating raw funk, slinky drums and weirdo house to devastating effect.

### Timeless Series #52 
> Moopie Timeless Series #52 This ambient and downtempo session is a mental massage for knotty thoughts. Ethereal pads, lush soundscapes and nature noises (frog ribbits, the plink of water droplets) seem to capture a time-lapse of a tropical ecosystem. Over the rhythmic chug of distorted synth lines, hissing melodies and barely there vocal samples, Moopie soundtracks a rainforest in transition, taking listeners across the seasons. It's an hour of pure, contemplative bliss—and a critical ear cleanse. This ambient and downtempo session is a mental massage for knotty thoughts.

### Truancy Volume 353 
> james K Truancy Volume 353 In the hands of james K, music becomes emotional architecture. Layering melancholy, surrender and longing alongside murkier feelings such as anxiety, the New York-based artist builds sets like an urban planner of the heart. This 74-minute trek across mediative downtempo, drum & bass and sample-based experimentalism finds through lines between artists on the opposite sides of the dance music spectrum, from the delicate piano notes of Tristan Arp to Marco Shuttle's quiet percussion. It ends on a bittersweet note with the IDM pop of Cybermission's "Deep Hard," which james K described as her "current favourite feeling" because "it's fun, beautiful and real."

### June 2025: Albums 

### **Tresor** - Black Sites – R4 (Tresor)
> Tresor Black Sites – R4 On R4, Helena Hauff and F#X recapture their legendary live-wire energy for the breeziest club record in Hauff's discography, and the danciest in F#X's. The album—the duo's first release in 11 years—provides plenty of opportunities for them to break out, like the crushingly heavy electro of "II," with its Nine Inch Nails-style distorted kick drums and curdled synths. "707," all jagged edges and jutting angles, sounds like they tried to make the ugliest acid track possible.

### **Tempa** - Introspekt – Moving the Center (Tempa)
> Tempa Introspekt – Moving the Center For her debut album on the storied dubstep label Tempa, Introspekt commits to actualising dubstep's sensual potential by incorporating elements of house, Detroit techno, UK garage and East Coast club. Her convergence of influences, from soulful shuffle to garage-grime, evokes Big Apple Records and early FWD>> parties, but without becoming bogged down in bland revivalism. Just listen to the thick, rolling riffs of wobble bass on "Make Me Dance" and "Respect," which channel the broodiness of Plastician's early tunes.

### **7K!** - Lyra Pramuk – Hymnal (7K!)
> 7K! Lyra Pramuk – Hymnal While working on her third album, Hymnal, Lyra Pramuk was moved by the beauty of the nature that surrounded her. Collaborating with a string quartet for the first time, she included flute, double bass and raw, improvised vocal harmonies that contrast with sleek electronic production. The resulting LP is multitudinal: tactile and knotty yet fluid and trance-like, offering all the forward-looking potential of electronic music while also drawing from generations of folk traditions.

> One Little Independent Nadah El Shazly – Laini Tani Spanning past and present with a singular unearthliness, Nadah El Shazly's filmic scope on Laini Tani reveals the intense curation of an auteur. The album opens with a deceptively dream-pop bent before blossoming into a genre-spanning ride of industrial, classical and trip-hop. Her lyrics come alive with the hustle and bustle of Cairo (her hometown), her interiority and the interplay between the two.

### **FURTHER** - DJ Bone – DJ Bone XXXV: The End of Never (FURTHER)
> FURTHER DJ Bone – DJ Bone XXXV: The End of Never In late May, DJ Bone decided to put out a whopping six releases to celebrate his accomplishments: five years of his FURTHER label, 30 years of his Subject Detroit label, 35 years in the music industry and, most importantly, his 55th birthday. The End of Never, the first of the six, offers more energy than his previous LPs, crackling with the futurism and thrust of the best Detroit techno. Take "Critical," which consists of little more than drums, a squelchy, two-chord Juno stab and hip-hop-coded vocals. It feels like mainlining a double espresso.

### **Dekmantel** - Polygonia – Dream Horizons (Dekmantel)
> Dekmantel Polygonia – Dream Horizons Polygonia's latest unfolds like the sci-fi film Annihilation, where the DNA of living organisms is refracted and reconstituted into forms that are mutated and haunting yet somehow still gorgeous. Her soft-focus atmospheres offer moments of introspection, while earthly textures become anchors as she observes her ephemeral worlds. In these dreamscapes, highlights like "Gate To Amygdala" and "Hidden Blue" reveal just how intricate the Munich-based act's sonic craftsmanship is.

### **Peak Oil** - Purelink – Faith (Peak Oil)
> Peak Oil Purelink – Faith Purelink's new album of glitch and ambient techno rewards listeners willing to sit with quiet. Over time, the record slowly reveals intricate networks of sound amid an unwavering blanket of echo and barely-there feedback. The group also fold vocals from selected vocalists—Loraine James and poet Angelina Nonaj—into the mix. Opening track "Looked Me Right In The Eye" conjures a soporific sense of nightfall. On "Circle Of Dust," it almost sounds like the trio is volleying a ball between them, a technique more befitting a jam band than an electronic group.

### **TraTraTrax** - Nick León – A Tropical Entropy (TraTraTrax)
> TraTraTrax Nick León – A Tropical Entropy When Joan Didion set her sights on Miami during its mid-'80s heyday, she looked past the pastel-hued condos to find a new form of hybridised decay—attempts to mask state-sanctioned corruption behind the veneer of a tropical paradise. It's an unexpected yet totally apt point of reference for Nick León, a proud ambassador of Miami's dance music scene. But A Tropical Entropy is far from a dour outing. "Ocean Apart," for instance, almost becomes a full-blown EDM rager, but backs away before the catharsis of a major drop.

> 28912 naemi – Breathless, Shorn Following up the excellent Dust Devil, Berlin-based artist naemi releases a slimmer album, with a tighter list of contributors. Baptist Goth delivers feathery indie vocals, and Foamy transports you to a dingy DIY venue via scruffy drums. The record still highlights naemi's strengths in shoegaze and hazy guitar, while also touching on ethereal folk ("fearless girl") and metallic jungle ("maze").

On highlights like lead single "Telenovela," her braggadocious reggaeton is infused with a theatrical narrative, while further in, she sings glamorously over loungey disco ("Pill") and raps over sparkly Y2K hip-hop on "Gorgeous."

These four tracks are a carnival ride through the past two decades of dance music—from French touch to dubstep, hip-hop to deconstructed club—stitched over erratic drum programming and imbued with bloghouse's cocaine-fueled irreverence.

### **Select Few** - Lauren Duffus – Can's Gone Warm (Select Few)
> Select Few Lauren Duffus – Can's Gone Warm These six tracks are a brilliant melange of trip-hop, grime, R&B and guitar music. "Super" shows off clicky percussion and icy synths, springing around the South London artist's reverbed falsetto in a way that recalls Fade to Mind-era Kelela. The vocal hook of "N.U.M.T.E.," another clear highlight, channels the serpentine sensuality of '90s R&B before diving into ricocheting jungle.

With a short, chipmunk sample looped over synths that sound like rubber bands, "FTRW!" is the kind of track that lights up festival stages. "Wolfgang" is similarly energetic.

### The Wednesday Alternative Mix 
> FFAN The Wednesday Alternative Mix Look for an apt description of FFAN's style, and "adult-oriented disco" might fit best. It was originally coined to describe the music of Prins Thomas, whose tracks appear in this high-energy hour of The Ransom Note's Wednesday Alternative Mix series. The term feels just right for the Nyapi owner's eclectic sound. Across the hour-long mix, the Seoul-based DJ maintains a medium tempo, blending dark, flamboyant elements—from gothic synths and vocals to acid flourishes and suspense-filled drum arrangements.

In a low-lit corner of Garage, Oceanic delved into the wonky side of house music—strange vocals, minimal classics and beatless synth workouts. Featuring Laurie Spiegel and Skee Mask, the two-and-a-half-hour recording is melodic and weightless in parts, heavy and heady in others—but consistently elevating.

Her sets, like this one for the increasingly essential Gyration Station series, are deliberately fast and ecstatic, moving through upbeat house selections that wouldn't be out of place in an Eris Drew and Octo Octa set.

### **Self-released** - OSSX – WORLD KEEPS TURNING (Self-released)
> Self-released OSSX – WORLD KEEPS TURNING Prolific New Jersey trio OSSX are keenly attuned to the needs of the dance floor. Their debut album wholeheartedly bolsters this reputation, spreading their signature East Coast club sound—hollering vocals, shuttling snares—over samples of '90s hits that almost seem too obvious (look out for Suzanne Vega's "Tom's Diner," Cheryl Lynn's "Got to Be Real"). But in OSSX's hands, pop and R&B become club tools that any smart DJ will keep in their kit. Listen: Bandcamp Prolific New Jersey trio OSSX are keenly attuned to the needs of the dance floor.

> ESCHO Smerz – Big city life On Big city life, Smerz finds a cohesive sound that elevates their place in the Norwegian experimental scene. By leaning into guitars, hook-driven R&B and low-slung electro, they've strengthened their storytelling chops (as on the string-led "Feisty" and the romance of "You got time and I got money") while keeping their loveable knack for weirdness.

### **Self-Released** - J. Albert – Return To Sender (Self-Released)
> Self-Released J. Albert – Return To Sender New York producer J. Albert returns with his first proper album in years. The focus? Stoner ambient and dub techno. "Warped Mirror" offers glimpses of his lo-fi house past with deep house chords and brittle dub architecture. "22" cuts through the vibey feel, descending into an industrial ambient abyss where synths snap and hiss like high-voltage power lines. One to sink into. Listen: Bandcamp New York producer J.

### **ANS Recordings** - Anthony Naples – Scanners (ANS Recordings)
> ANS Recordings Anthony Naples – Scanners There's plenty to marvel at on Anthony Naples' sixth album, Scanners. "Lifetimes" has an R&B feel to its gilded chords and an East Coast shuffle to its booming drums. "Bounce" is slick, tunnelling techno. "Somebody"'s stuttering, detuned piano notes slip intricately in and out of a punchy four-to-the-floor beat. The rhythms are tight and addictive from the start, the melodies keeping you tethered to the endless groove. Listen: Bandcamp There's plenty to marvel at on Anthony Naples' sixth album, Scanners.

Garage 909 kicks shuffle across the pansexual anthem "FREAKY (JUST MY TYPE);" "XTC SUSP9ND3D" uses a blipping hardcore vocal before a torrent of layered footwork sub-bass floods in; and she even includes Cameo Blush's moody saxophone melody on "LOVE YOUR ENEMIES."

F*CK U is stuffed with formerly unreleased productions that fans have long been hearing in his sets.

Noise columns meet otherworldly, loosely stacked guitar notes. Standout "Professional Vengeance" could've been a Pixies song in another life, if the group played so hard and fast that the studio imploded.

> Hyperdub Nazar – Demilitarize War is a central theme of Nazar's work. The lasers that blast through the redlining sub-bass of "Warning Shots," off his debut EP Enclave, were an early taste of what the Amsterdam-based producer would later call "rough kuduro."

But on new album, It's Later Than You Think, he makes a hard left turn to take on the vast spectrum of house. There's the hardgroove-meets-house of "Admirer," and "Monsters," a throwback to the early-'90s drum work of DJ Pierre and Zip's '00s minimal.

> Club Romántico v1fro – Amnesia EP On this EP, Venezuelan native v1fro proves he's fit to carry on raptor house's legacy. Like the best of the homegrown dance genre, once the momentum starts, it drives relentlessly forward with every galloping drum loop. But he also takes the sound further. On "Amnesia," you hear snippets of house and tunnelling acid lines, while bleating synths on "Piñata" feel primed for a carnival sound system. The remix treatments include none other than Bok Bok, Coffintexts and raptor house originator DJ Babatr.

### **Butter Sessions** - Sleep D – Big Sky, Liquid Sun (Butter Sessions)
> Butter Sessions Sleep D – Big Sky, Liquid Sun Arriving just in time for Earth Month, Sleep D's latest EP is full of terrestrial wonders. "Green Thumbs" takes its sparkly ambience and downtempo pace from serene plant life, while "Acheron Caulderon" (named after the Greek underworld's "river of woe") is tunnelling techno that still maintains Sleep D's signature glistening atmospheres.

### **Jump Source** - Jump Source – JS06 (Jump Source)
> Jump Source Jump Source – JS06 Will "On" be the song of the summer? Time will tell, but for now we're certain it's rousing dance floors. A track that features shout-outs can really get a crowd going, so with Martyn Bootyspoon's gravelly voice checking in on everyone from "New York to Milan" and the "front row getting down," this is a bona fide hit. The rest of the EP is just as strong, with "Bleach" representing classic Montreal progressive house—ebullient and driving. Listen: Bandcamp Will "On" be the song of the summer?

Trim is known for making outsider grime peppered with jazz, hip-hop, soul and whatever else takes his fancy—nothing is off the cards.

### **Tempa** - Carré – Body Shell (Tempa)
> Tempa Carré – Body Shell London-via-Los Angeles artist Carré is responsible for some of the sleekest dubstep in recent years. Here, she lands on one of the genre's most iconic labels, Tempa, with a tantalising suite of minimal and melodic rollers—all anchored by wall-rattling bass weight. But heavy as it is, the productions are still elegantly roomy. Just listen to "Faded Form," which feels simultaneously close and miles away.

### **Warner Records** - PinkPantheress – Tonight (Warner Records)
> Warner Records PinkPantheress – Tonight "Tonight" is the most club-ready song that PinkPantheress has delivered in some time. With crisp, balmy chords and a carefree UK garage skip, this is the artist's clear play to honour the UK underground stylings she grew up on while setting the stage for a more mainstream audience. The lyrics are deliriously fun in the way music should be in the warmer months. Expect to hear "You want sex with me? (huh) / Come talk to me (come on!)" on your local dance floor soon.

### Zjoso Live @ Golden Plains Festival 
> Zjoso Zjoso Live @ Golden Plains Festival Tribqu founder Zjoso brought some serious soul to his two-hour set at Australia's Golden Plains Festival last month.

### Making Time 2024 
> John Talabot Making Time 2024 John Talabot has long defied categorisation with sets that slip between genres with intention and finesse. House? Not quite. Techno? Close, but not really. Eclectic? Sure, but that barely scratches the surface. In this recording from the 2024 edition of Philadelphia's Making Time festival, one thing's clear: Talabot is fully locked in, moving through everything from sleazy acid to high-octane trance.

### March 2025: Albums 

### **Temporal Drift** - Hiroshi Yoshimura – Flora (Temporal Drift)
> Temporal Drift Hiroshi Yoshimura – Flora Hiroshi Yoshimura was a revered figure in kankyō ongaku, Japan's environmental music scene, known for creating artfully unobtrusive works like Surround and the seminal Music for Nine Post Cards. This posthumous album offers a fresh perspective on a musician best known for meditative atmospherics. In contrast to the quiet subtleties of his early records, tracks like "Maple Syrup Factory" sound like Yoshimura's equivalent of a pop song. Bouncy and engaging, Flora's playful pace actively asks for your focus.

### **Hyperdub** - aya – hexed! (Hyperdub)
> Hyperdub aya – hexed! The cosmic darkness of aya's debut album, im hole, is best captured by its lead single, "Emley lights us moor." The song is terrifying, comprising macabre field recordings and uneasy synths that soundtrack a mind seemingly caught between psychosis and epiphany. Three years on, the most surprising aspect of aya's follow-up, hexed!, is just how deliberately it functions as a sequel: eerie spoken-word morphs into screams, while drums and lasers clatter together relentlessly. On hexed!, she draws from metalcore, IDM and hardstyle, ditching cloistered inwardness for a cathartic expulsion of energy.

### **Numbers.** - Unspecified Enemies – Romance in the Age of Adaptive Feedback (Numbers.)
> Numbers. Unspecified Enemies – Romance in the Age of Adaptive Feedback Louis Digital—AKA Unspecified Enemies—has always looked ahead with a cynical eye. His scattered discography often references the late urban theorist Mike Davis, namechecking his interrogations of systems of power, explored in books like City of Quartz and Ecology of Fear. Louis Digital moulded the first Unspecified Enemies album from puzzle pieces of synths, samples and sequences made in the early '00s. Romance in the Age of Adaptive Feedback flips Davis's pessimism to transmit the hopeful mood of the new millennium.

> !K7 Logic1000 – DJ-Kicks: Logic1000 Logic1000's DJ-Kicks entry dips into a startlingly intimate headspace. Though decades separate the release dates of her selections, her transitions grow together with preternatural symbiosis. Entries from the actual '90s—a quick excerpt from Dettinger's 1999 ambient pop touchstone Intershop, the intro to Wamdue Kids' 1996 deep house LP These Branching Moments—knit into contemporary Y2K throwbacks, like the smouldering trip-hop of a.s.o.'s "Somebody" and the ethereal downtempo of Moon Holiday's "Definitely."

### **The Point Of Departure** - Sandwell District – End Beginnings (The Point Of Departure)
> The Point Of Departure Sandwell District – End Beginnings When Silent Servant died in 2024, the tragedy triggered an outpouring of sorrow from the artists, fans and friends he touched, both as a solo artist and part of techno collective Sandwell District. End Beginnings is a masterclass in devastatingly uncompromising techno, completed by surviving members Function and Regis. Their reverb-heavy loops have always been melancholic at their core, but here, they recede further into the darkness. It's a beautiful elegy.

### **Pink Oyster Records** - Yetsuby – 4EVA (Pink Oyster Records)
> Pink Oyster Records Yetsuby – 4EVA 4EVA is by far the most vibrant and dance floor-oriented of Yetsuby's solo records, finding common ground in the torrent of breaks and bass that build its rhythmic core. The UK club canon holds court on the album, manifesting as a sliding scale of extremes from the bitcrushed, whippet-pressurised subs of "SOUNDCLOUD" to the sweet and hooky pop breakbeats of "Aestheti-Q."

> Self-Released Los Thuthanaka – Los Thuthanaka At long last, the follow-up to Joshua Chuquimia Crampton's Estrella por Estrella and Chuquimamani-Condori's DJ E is here. The experimental sibling duo have joined forces on their debut album as Los Thuthanaka. The LP makes excellent use of Joshua's emotional, drone-like bass guitar work, while Chiquimamani-Condori's blown-out collages of ronroco, teclas and bombo italaque make even the most granular moments swell with hope, wonder and spirituality.

> Kullijhan Records Time Cow – Scaring 1100 Chickens To Death As a founding member of Jamaica's Equiknoxx crew, Time Cow has spent many years reinvigorating dub and dancehall for a modern generation. Recently, the producer has made a new home for his solo and collaborative work in Kullijhan Records. Scaring 1100 Chickens To Death, his debut album for the label, isn't as scary as its title suggests: clicky percussion dribbles through weighty low-end on "Guns Drugs and 800 Parrots" and synths squawk like screeching parrots on "Soca Numa."

### **SILLAGE** - 8ULENTINA – SURPASSING DISASTER (SILLAGE)
> SILLAGE 8ULENTINA – SURPASSING DISASTER 8ULENTINA's debut LP comes after more than a decade of helping steer the Bay Area and New York underground. SURPASSING DISASTER as informed by industrial and dark ambient as the artist's Turkish roots. Arab acoustic instrumentation is threaded into haunting corridors of crushed bass and blistering kicks. The cursive whispers of a ney meld into cinematic synths on "Devotional," while rich-toned hand drums and cymbals punctuate the sinister synthline on "Desire Ruse." A spellbinding work.

> Príncipe DJ Narciso – Diferenciado Príncipe showcases another impressive configuration of Lisbon's thriving batida scene with DJ Narciso's debut LP. The producer, who's also the brain behind the collective Rs Produções, carves out a sound that carries a lilting danceability (perfectly demonstrated on "Pipipi" or "5 Do Jo") while "Underground dos Loucos" and "30 Paus" champion the more choppy, experimental edges of club music.

### **Headroom Records** - Various Artists – Sueños en la Tormenta (Headroom Records)
> Headroom Records Various Artists – Sueños en la Tormenta Bogotá-born producer CRRDR has been one of the loudest supporters of post-pandemic Latin-made club music—a movement he playfully dubbed "Latincore." This compilation he curated highlights an exhilarating blend of UK hardcore and rhythmic club sounds that fold in elements of raptor house, speed dembow and cumbia. This is music to make the floor shake—from the lightning-fast baile funk of LAZA's "Perturbação" to the steamy guaracha of Noro$t's "Déjela Sonar."

### **Ghostly International** - Whatever The Weather – Whatever The Weather II (Ghostly International)
> Ghostly International Whatever The Weather – Whatever The Weather II Loraine James's fragmented music puts a heartfelt bent on glitchy IDM, gilded atmospherics and hushed, intimate vocals. But when she debuted her Whatever The Weather alias in 2022, she leaned further into her long-standing guitar and ambient influences, such as on the frigid, delicate chords of "0°C" and the skipping, airy pads of "30°C." Her second album under this name evokes images of arid terrain and sun-dappled dirt, with productions that shine with golden hues.

### **XL Recordings** - DJ Python – i was put on this earth (XL Recordings)
> XL Recordings DJ Python – i was put on this earth DJ Python's Luis alias has long been a vessel for his '90s chillout stylings, and has increasingly bled into other areas of his discography. 2023's Natural Wonder Beauty Concept project with Ana Roxanne, for example, showcased less of the "deep reggaeton" he made his name with, instead presenting a gorgeous world of detuned keys, breakbeats and melodic IDM. Python's latest solo EP, i was put on this earth, feels like a natural progression, making elegant use of bleeps, burling guitar and the low-key vocals of Isabella Lovestory and Jawnino. A meditative beauty.

On HaRDD, vocalist Kablito's sugary tone coats driving synthlines, but she completes her pop star arc with hooky songs like "Cera El Cielo." On the more vulnerable "Linda, Triste, Una Pop Star," she ponders traditional family life in Spanish, before she remembers with a laugh, "my boyfriend and I, we're DJs."

> Self-released MoMA Ready – MR001 The agenda of MoMA Ready's first record of 2025? Gritty, romantic house. The New York producer leaves behind samples to put his own words front and centre, bringing earnest poetry to songs like "Suddenly," where love begets feelings of self-acceptance ("I feel like I belong / And there's nothing wrong"). The emotional tone of the EP—and the ecstasy it chases after—is no less driving than his peak-time anthems.

Its new initiative, Sounding the Collection, allows musicians to access this archive and use samples recorded at the museum to create their own original musical responses. On B12, Jlin makes use of a talking robot, an Irish harp and a wire-tying machine, with hazy melodies grounding the rhythmic chaos.

### Praia - Waking Life '25 (Upsammy)
> This two-hour recording of upsammy at Portugal's Waking Life festival in June is a spellbinding trip from zero to 100. Rhythmic techno and electro at its very best.

### Dekmantel 10 (Steffi)
> Christmas came early this month when Dekmantel dropped 70-plus recordings from their mammoth tenth edition in August. From the many excellent sets, this one from Steffi is a highlight. Closing out the Selectors stage, she went deep, dramatic and driving, moving through house, techno and electro in quintessentially Steffi style.

### Escenia 084 (Dj Popup)
> Since the mid-'10s, some of the best house music has consistently been coming out of Denmark, courtesy of the Regelbau crew in Aarhus.NES label head DJ Popup is continuing this legacy for the 2020s. The Copenhagen-based DJ puts together 70 minutes of deep house for the Mexican mix series Esencia, channeling vintage New York house and the hazy pads of Vancouver, with hints of UK garage.

### A Far Blue (Sam Goku)
> Sam Goku lays down an excellent 90 minutes for the latest mix in the Far Blue series. Balancing various textures without sacrificing depth and groove, it's one that's equally suited to home listening and the club."I recorded this mix right after I came back from my Asia tour," the Chinese-German artist wrote on SoundCloud. "Maybe it reflects the serenity I [felt] after returning from an inspiring trip-I felt very unrushed while recording it. What I also took home from this trip is a renewed fascination for textures of all kinds, which gave this mix its name. I hope you enjoy."

### Sparkling 02 (DJ Frog)
> Running parties and releasing music on Doo Records, DJ Frog is a local legend of the Montreal scene. It's not hard to see why: for the latest edition of Pascale Project's new mix series, Sparkling, she delivers a vinyl-only hour of crunchy minimal house and techno, closing out with the timeless "Planet Be (Hashman deejay remix)". One for any fan of Acting Press or PLO Man.

### SWOON | 18.10.2024 (Soria)
> An hour of sprawling, dubbed-out soundscapes on the latest Swoon podcast, courtesy of Dublin-via-Berlin DJ Soria.As noted in the description, the mix is inspired "by the main character from 'A Spy in the House of Love' by Anais Nin. Here the protagonist bathes at night in moonlight as one would in the sun, cultivating a power from its rays which pulls in and frightens the other characters around her. A reminder of the strength we have when we allow ourselves access to our own sensuality."

### Dub Delights XIII (Andy Martin & Sarcus Soundsystem)
> Guadalajara-based favourite Andy Martin and the Parisian trio Sarcus Soundsystem take the reins of the dependably sick Dub Delights show on Rinse France. The result: two hours of dub-adjacent sounds, from Tikiman to Dubamine.

### The Bunker Podcast 233 (Mike Servito & Jeffrey Sifre)
> Of the many events across Movement weekend, Return to the Source makes for a consistent highlight. International Transmissions leads the event series encompassing parties like No Way Back and The Bunker, the latter of which hosted Mike Servito and Jeffrey Sfire earlier this year."Mike Servito always majestically closes out No Way Back, but what would this combination bring? Sfire brought the heat, and their styles melded in a slightly pitched-down form, music from all eras appeared," No Way Back cofounder BMG wrote of the duo's The Bunker mix on Instagram. "A magical closing set that naturally extended from two hours to five hours of pure heat from two DJs whose whole [lives are] this music and this culture—who could ask for more?"

Date: 2024-10-02T17:00:56.000Z

### Monolake - Studio (Imbalance Computer Music)
> The tenth Monolake album is Robert Henke's best in a decade. Most refreshing is that after a slew of academic-leaning releases, it sounds like he's finally having fun.Listen:Bandcamp

### Dar Disku - Dar Disku (Soundway Records)
> UK-based, Bahraini-born childhood friends Mazen AlMaskati and Vish Matre have long been on a journey to archive and safeguard the music that reminds them of home—with their own twist. On their self-titled debut album, they accomplish this so well that you'd be forgiven for thinking it was a reissue, not something released in 2024.Listen:Bandcamp

### Nídia & Valentina - Estradas (Latency)
> Two percussionists from vastly different sonic worlds meet up, and the results are astounding. Valentina Magaletti brings a warm human element to Nídia's sharp kuduro.Listen:Bandcamp

### Nala Sinephro - Endlessness (Warp)
> On Nala Sinephro's long-awaited second album, she transforms the glossy ambient-jazz that debuted on Space 1.8. This time, she hollows out the rich, meandering curvatures of jazz to land on isolated arpeggios that share more in common with ambient.Listen:Bandcamp

### Various - Dekmantel Ten: A Decade of Dekmantel Festival (Dekmantel)
> One of Europe's most respected festivals celebrates ten years with DJs inseparable from the event, with uneven results.Listen:Bandcamp

Luckily, the esteemed selector's 90-minute debut was recorded, joining Animalia's vaunted mix series."Playing one of the first sets and seeing the room, decor and the big bad subs of Room 2, years of fantastical lore and reality melded, I wanted to keep it sexy, wonky, trippy," they wrote. "Imagining a psychic electric swamp and how one would levitate through it... to the sky."

### Jaleo Real 2024 (Rachael)
> Originally from Zaragoza, Rachael is a favourite across Spain's underground scene. This stomping two-hour, all-vinyl set shows the Madrid-based DJ in excellent form.

One for any Eris Drew or Angel D'lite fan.

### Critical Sound Summer Sonics London (Samurai Breaks)

> Berlin-based event series Multisex is an unabashed house music affair.

### Sustain Release '23 (Ben UFO)
> No one does it quite like Ben. In this live set from Sustain-Release 2023, the Hessle Audio mastermind is in peak form, flowing effortlessly through the many shades of speed garage, wiggly tech house and wonky techno. His impeccable ear shines as he weaves together the summer anthems of 2023 and 2024—Theo Kottis’s "Lighthouse," Pangaea’s "Installation" and Peverlist's "Pulse VII"—making them feel both refreshingly new and warmly familiar.

### BFC Summer in the City 2024 @ Der Hintergarten (Ciel & Priori)

## [August's Best Music](https://ra.co/features/4373)
Date: 2024-09-04T15:00:02.000Z

### Seefeel - Everything Squared (Warp)
> The experimental band's first extended release in 13 years doesn't feel like a band trading on their reputation—the initial impression is one of change. Everything Squared finds Mark Clifford zeroing in on his production process while Sarah Peacock's vocals continue to provide a crucial human quality to the band's reliably enigmatic sound. Listen: Bandcamp

### Tinashe - Quantum Baby (Nice Life records)
> Outside the brief flirtations on Quantum Baby's singles—including of course, the viral hit "Nasty"—Tinashe's seventh album is really about striving for authenticity. The 22-minute album leans toward the hazy, subdued end of her catalogue, while still delivering on the kind of smoky, sexy numbers that we'd expect from her. Listen: Apple

### Kampire - Kampire Presents: A Dancefloor in Ndola (Strut)
> Kampire has helped champion envelope-pushing East and South African music from the '70s up to the present day. On her debut compilation, she steps into the role of curator proper. A Dancefloor in Ndola is a captivating exercise in crate-diggery, setting renowned heavyweights like Samba Mapangala and Tshala Muana next to unpolished gems with gritty production values, party-ready grooves and minimal Google footprints. Listen: Bandcamp

### Loidis - One Day (Incienso)
> Huerco S. brings back his Loidis alias on One Day, a stripped-back record that shows the producer falling back in love with the art of a simple loop. Across eight tracks, he writes deep, muted and wobbly rhythms filled with the sort of gorgeous dub techno melodicism you might hear on a Shinichi Atobe record. Listen: Bandcamp

### Chrystabell & David Lynch - Cellophane Memories (Sacred Bones)
> Across Cellophane Memories's 37 minutes, the pair's longstanding creative chemistry takes a new and arresting shape. Stripped of burdensome song forms and almost entirely absent of beats or easy melodies, something genuinely mysterious emerges—a mystery you'd be tempted to describe as "Lynchian" even without knowing who was behind it. Listen: Bandcamp

### Jon Hopkins - Ritual (Domino)
> Jon Hopkins began his journey making "serious, emotional" music with 2021's hazy, beatless Music For Psychedelic Therapy. The follow-up to that album, Ritual, originated from music Hopkins wrote for an installation called Dreamachine, named after a 1959 invention heralded as "the first art object to be seen with eyes closed." The 41-minute composition expands into eight parts that unfurl like a guided meditation. Listen: Apple

### Laurie Anderson - Amelia (Nonesuch)
> When Laurie Anderson—who first conceived of Amelia as a stage performance 24 years ago—was asked on BBC Radio 4 why Amelia Earhart's story appealed to her, the answer was simple: "She was a bad-girl pilot—and I liked that." On the LP, Anderson follows the late pilot's final flight path. The album plays like an audio documentary, drawing directly from Earhart's writing and strapping us into the plane with Earhart with shaky, surround-sound instrumentation. Listen: Bandcamp

### Various - Time Passages 10 Years (Time Passages)
> A decade is a long time in dance music, but longevity looks good on the techno label Time Passages. On the anniversary compilation, Binh's label remains the high watermark for low-slung and sinister minimal electro and techno. Listen: SoundCloud

### Nectax - Body Talk (Play:Musik)
> On the first release in 14 years on Play:Musik, Nectax brings the same shapeshifting energy of the label's early output. Across four slickly produced tracks, he connects elements of footwork, jungle, techno and hardcore on an impressively varied EP that vividly reimagines the sonic kinship between those genres. Listen: Bandcamp

### Danny Daze & Jonny From Space - Tumbadora EP (Craigie Knowles)
> On Tumbadora, Danny Daze and Jonny From Space reunite for an EP that swaps the introspection of their respective debut albums for three original cuts of sludgy, polyrhythmic electro and techno. It even includes a cameo from Miami's other wunderkind, Nick León. Listen: Bandcamp

### Ciel & CCL - Tilda's Goat Stare (NAFF)
> On Tilda's Goat Stare, Ciel & CCL's debut collaboration's chaotic feminist streak found a fitting anchor in the 2002 sci-fi feminist film Teknolust. Much of the EP lands with a thwack, top-loaded with precisely the kind of dusty peak-time tracks you'd find in the duo's festival sets. Listen: Bandcamp

### Dubbel Dutch - Cosmic Tone Poems (Rare Earth Tones)
> Over a decade since Dubbel Dutch's last solo release, one of the breakthrough stars of the post-dubstep bubble returns after literally going off the grid. Cosmic Tone Poems is built around the contrast between synth lines that float like champagne bubbles and basslines that plunge the tracks down to earth, updating the sort of genre promiscuity he championed in the '10s. Listen: Bandcamp

### gyrofield - These Heavens (XL Recordings)
> The producer makes their debut on XL with a dynamic EP inspired by a night out in Bristol. Over four tracks, they swerve from angular acidlines to delectable, sputtering drum & bass breaks. Listen: Bandcamp

### All Arthur Russell DJ set, live at The Barbican (JD Twitch)

### GROOVE Podcast 428 (Mattias El Mansouri)
> For the 428th GROOVE Podcast, Stockholm-based DJ and producer Mattias El Mansouri delivers a stellar two-hour mix, traversing eclectic boogies from the likes of The Durutti Column and Barrington Levy to the deep minimal rhythms of Arkajo and Dorisburg.

### XLR8R Podcast 863 (Assyouti)
> The Berlin-based producer and DJ goes tear-out, spinning hard-as-nails choppage from the likes of Breakage, B-Key and Champa B. If you like your drum & bass dark and weighty, this one's for you.

### Rinse FM (Ploy)
> While he may have initially made his name releasing wonky bassbin tracks on the likes of Hessle Audio, Timedance and Hemlock, Ploy isn't one to be pinned down. On the July edition of his Rinse FM show, the Bristol-based DJ and producer demonstrates that he's equally comfortable (and excellent) at playing house.

### Freerotation 2024 : The House Of Crocodiles Part 2 (Live Recording) (Nono Gigsta)
> No rhythm, tempo or genre is off limits in this truly ecstatic and goosebump-inducing set, recorded live at Freerotation from Cashmere Radio resident Nono Gigsta. Oh and there's not one but two Björk moments—enjoy.

### Kiosk Radio 11.08.2024 (DJ Maria)
> With regular appearances at Berghain, Bassiani and VENT, DJ MARIA. is one of the best DJs to emerge out of Japan in recent years.Guesting on Kiosk Radio, the Tokyo-based artist delivers a masterclass in building atmosphere, perfectly balancing muscle with texture (including one particularly mind-bending transition in which it sounds like she mixes a field recording from a working kitchen into Ben Klock's "Wolf"). It's the kind of eye-opening session that makes you want to listen to all her other mixes right after.

### Live at Nowadays 7 April 2024 (Objekt)
> Objekt is one of the most dynamic artists in underground techno today, and this recording—from the equally influential New York club Nowadays—captures him on typically excellent form."I played on Sunday morning from 9 AM to 3 PM, between JASSS and Bearcat," he said, calling it "one of the most creatively fulfilling sets I can remember playing–one of those sets where the audience, environment, atmosphere, tech setup, phase of the moon, whatever, all somehow lined up for a full six hours."

### Down The Rabbit Hole 2024 (Sarkawt Hamad)
> The versatile Amsterdam-based DJ covers a lot of ground in this two-hour live recording from Down The Rabbit Hole. You can hear her adventurous approach in full bloom, moving through starry-eyed house, hypnotic techno, squelchy acid and more from the likes of Peach, Polygonia and Zephyr.

> Emotional Machine Funk2025 has been defined by the collapse of techno optimism. Where the nascent internet's frontier spirit once pointed to a bright future, today that promise feels sinister, curdled by the "corporate gloom" and data extraction documented in Liz Pelly's excellent book, Mood Machine. The year's most compelling machine funk reflects this irradiated state of distress on a personal and collective level, as well as caution about what our technological destiny truly holds.The electro, techno and slanted IDM we listened to in 2025 went beyond techno pessimism to focus on other knotty concepts, such as grief and loss, provoking visceral gut punches to attain those physical highs. It's music that makes you feel and move, which, if you go back to Detroit techno's history, has always been there. No one told this story better than the Motor City's early pioneers, whose fragile and furious proto-techno output was never blindly optimistic. RA's staff picks of the year pull from this DNA: DJ Bone's The End Of Never, with its muscular electro, stands as the embodiment of Detroit, rooted in a '90s urban reality that focused on interrogating systems of power and decay.These ghosts of past motifs echo through these releases, which are neither hopeful nor nostalgic throwbacks. This is machine music deeply rooted in the turmoil of the present, asserting that the sound of the zeitgeist refuses to be background noise. It's a defiant new link in a chain of creation that speaks to adversity, and it demands that we listen. What does that say about 2025, that artists are trying to produce music that says something through bleeps and bloops again?– Chloe LulaRecord of the YearBlawanSickElixirAfter more than a decade at the forefront of club music, Blawan could easily have settled into legacy act territory, churning out formulaic imitations of past successes from the comfort of the techno assembly line. Instead, on SickElixir, he doubles down on innovation.The album finds the UK artist at his most vulnerable. Themes of grief, trauma and addiction (he recently spoke to Crack about having to leave Berlin after drugs "basically shattered" his life there) are folded into serrated rhythms and monstrous, almost bodily vocal work—even fleeting moments of warmth arrive refracted through a darker lens. The ferocity of his early work remains, yet the melodic smears, fragmented vocal gasps and unexpectedly tender swells reflect an artist intent on expanding his emotional bandwidth. SickElixir sees Blawan turn years of experience into something raw and profound.– Michael LawsonRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordsMarie DavidsonCity Of ClownsIn a world shackled by surveillance capitalism, Marie Davidson posits what might be the only true subversion left: satirising this power structure with sexual hedonism run rampant. City Of Clowns brings this madcap concept to life. Thunderous, funky basslines and mind-melting electro synths are helmed by Davidson, who plays the Alexa-like narrator gone rogue, extolling the virtues of data mining with expletives and double entendres. If the machinist future our tech overlords are envisioning is even one tenth as sexy as this, bring on the singularity.– Jake IndianaRead the full reviewListen:BandcampUnspecified EnemiesRomance in the Age of Adaptive FeedbackPart of the enduring magic of '90s Detroit-school techno is how the producers made pieces of hardware sing. Louis Digital isn't from Detroit and it isn't the mid-90s, but you can't tell by listening to Romance in the Age of Adaptive Feedback. Equal parts nostalgic and futuristic, brimming with feeling and assembly-line grooves, the record is a pitch-perfect homage to classic Motor City techno and electro by a true lover of the form.– Henry IvryRead the full reviewListen:BandcampTracksDJ Bone"Deep Inside"On "Deep Inside," DJ Bone pairs his famously surgical drumwork with a simple vocal mantra, a reminder that there's a human pulse driving the circuitry. As the oscillating synths kick in, elastic and almost overcooked, the track feels like a machine learning its purpose, pushed by a human hand that refuses to let the gears lock into place. The way he flares open the mix turns his tight grid into something that emulates a living, breathing organism.– Reid BGRead the full reviewListen:BandcampSandwell District"Hidden"Austere techno brutalism be damned—on End Beginnings highlight, "Hidden," Regis and Function returned to their Sandwell District project with a rounded melodic sound that found its pocket and leaned deep into it. The track's interplay between insistent acid, throbbing mono synth bass and syncopated sub rumble displays a funkiness more readily associated with Motor City titans. "Hidden" evokes the shadowy, emotive pulse of Carl Craig classic "Sandstorms" while giving it the Sandwell District pressure-cooker treatment.– Oli WarwickRead the full reviewListen:BandcampMixLimited NetworkITPS119 LIMITED NETWORKAs Limited Network, Detroit-based artist Max Watts channels the city's lineage, using the TB-303 to connect classic machine funk with its sleek 2020s mutation. His Ilian Tape mix opens with tight 303 sequences: clean resonance peaks, controlled envelopes and a filter sweep that traces a line from forebears like Robert Hood and Jeff Mills. Rather than treat acid as nostalgia, the mix unfolds with curiosity, moving through Drexciya-esque passages and punchy electro workouts. Watts honours Detroit's foundations while showing how the machine-funk blueprint still resonates today.– Bella AquilinaListen:SoundCloudFurther ListeningPolygonia, Wata IgarashiCross PassageListen:BandcampBlack SitesR4Listen:BandcampEhua"Aria"Listen:BandcampBarker"Stochastic Drift"Read the reviewListen:BandcampTraxxThe Definitive Articles of House Music Chapter 6Listen:SoundCloudListen to the Emotional Machine Funk playlistSpotify

> Bass WeightWe should've clocked it when FWD>> and Tempa returned. From late 2024 through 2025, bass weight has been pushed into new places. From Bristol outlet Dimeshift, which continues to lead fresh, first wave-inspired dubstep, to Beatrice M., who released a strong run of their own tunes, as well as issuing music from the likes of Tighe, Old Man Crane and Dangermami via their label, Bait.Across the board, artists increasingly unified the roots of sound system music with their own astute, modern twists, propelled by a more femme-led, internationally reaching school of artists and labels. Introspekt's Moving the Center unlocked a newfound sensuality in dubstep and dark garage; tracks like Mia Koden's "Skank Steady" bottled anticipation for summer with floating keys and a warm bassline; Lauren Duffus's excellent Can's Gone Warm EP served weighty alt-pop, folding in trip-hop and post-dubstep shimmer reminiscent of Kelela's Cut 4 Me. And then Tracey & Riko Dan's "Sex Life" abandoned elegance entirely, taking a thrumming low-end and plonking a pithy hook on top: "All I wanna do is fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck."Alongside Beatrice M., names like EMA were busy earning much-deserved flowers with standout festival sets, while legends assembled in the form of Mala and dub techno veteran Paul St. Hilaire, who collaborated on "Like It's Always Been," the opening track on St. Hilaire's album. In a year that Timedance and SPE:C turned ten (and Tectonic hit 20), techno-infused bass weight stocks are arguably at an all-time high, and sound system music at large is, in all senses of the word, booming.– Nathan EvansRecord of the YearPaul St. Hilairew/ the ProducersFor Kynant Records' Richard Akingbehin and the voice of dub techno, Paul St. Hilaire, the decision to summon the ghost of Rhythm & Sound's seminal 2003 album, w/ the Artists, was classy yet bold. Would w/ the Producers build on its source material? Or risk living in its shadow? The album's faultless cast of collaborators, including Batu, Shinichi Atobe and Azu Tiwaline, made failure impossible. As a sonic aesthetic, dubwise is flourishing right now, and this LP bottles its power and beauty in myriad tones and tempos, from Mala's orchestral skank on "Like It's Always Been" to the slo-mo psych thump of Aurora Halal & DJ G's "Mary Jane Greenfield." The pièce de résistance is, of course, St. Hilaire himself. He graces every beat with poise and purpose, never overdoing it. As the years roll by, once-mythic musicians can lose touch with their former brilliance. Not this Dominican dub poet.– Carlos HawthornRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordsIntrospektMoving The CenterIntrospekt has what you want and what you need. Sound familiar? You might recognise those words from KMA Productions' '96 garage track "Cape Fear," which Introspekt samples on "Subliminate," the final track on her debut album. From the New York-based artist, what we want is something new, fresh and stimulating in a way we've not experienced before. And what we need is dubstep. Introspekt delivers both, making bass-heavy 140 riddims sound smoother and sexier than ever.– Sam DaviesRead the full reviewListen:Bandcampex_libris001 & 002Every time Dave Huismans returns, it's cause for celebration. Just one catch: the lexicon of writers and fans alike falls short in capturing his aversion to fixed form. What exactly is ex_libris? Iridescent, deep electronics, backed by a swirl of percussion and an exceptional attention to textural detail? Rolls right off the tongue. At any rate, this headphone-friendly double drop sums the qualities of his best-known projects—2562's swampy low-end, A Made Up Sound's nonlinear jams—in a teeming soundscape with an almost hydraulic sense of progression. "It has a lot of character," he once told us about his gear, "and that's why I like it." Dave, the feeling's mutual.– Gabriel SzatanListen:BandcampTracksTracey"Sex Life"The anonymous London-based duo knocked everyone out of the park with their self-titled debut. Press play once and you'll be convinced. "Sex Life" is deadly dubstep in classic form, with a searing verse from vaunted MC Riko Dan. But then, there's a twist. "Sex Life" also features surprising interludes of twinkling synths and bubblegum vocal loops with a bedroom pop feel—inflections that add a touch of irreverent internet humour. It's a perfect marriage of neon pop and bass weight—a uniquely 2025 take on dubstep.– Nyshka ChandranListen:BandcampLauren Duffus"N.U.M.T.E."Lauren Duffus's Can's Gone Warm EP is her best work yet. On "N.U.M.T.E," fragile, R&B-inflected vocals float over jittery breakbeats and shadowy synths, recalling the likes of Murlo and MssingNo without ever feeling derivative. The track inhabits the liminal space between the club and the lonely hours after closing, leaving a lingering sense of longing wrapped in mystery. It's exactly the kind of idiosyncratic, emotionally vivid production that marked Duffus as one of the year's most compelling artists.– Fahad AkinsanyaListen:BandcampMixBeatrice M.THE DUBSTEP - TECH HOUSE CONNECTIONIn this NTS Radio entry, Beatrice M. explores the connection between two once maligned genres, dubstep and tech house. Joined by Appleblim, they map the sonic bridge from Bristol to Berlin, zeroing in on the collision point where technoid bass hybrids meet skippy 120-BPM rollers—the juncture where Villalobos can bring low-end into his sets or Shackleton can put steppers onto Perlon. All the greats are there: Margaret Dygas, Sub Basics, Pinch, Zenker Brothers.

> Neo Electronic PopFrom Ray of Light to BRAT, pop records have long repurposed club culture to delight the masses. But in 2025, a sort of reverse osmosis emerged: cutting-edge producers found new avenues for experimentation in pop's effervescent packaging. From Shanti Celeste's glossy love songs on Romance to Oli XL's K-pop meets IDM on Lick The Lens, there's a clear uptick in the use of radio-ready melodies. In a moment when big-room dance music is more mainstream (and more mind-numbing) than ever, underground artists returned to pop as a point of subversion; a new way to enliven drum & bass, trance and trip-hop without sullying the source material.The relationship between pop and dance music dates back to the '80s, when artists like Boy George and The Human League first conceived of pop as a self-aware art form, not a chart metric. Their vision was fuelled by the same anti-establishment spirit that influenced club innovators like Larry Heard and Underground Resistance. In 2025, pop sounds more in line with that original art punk mentality than it has in decades. There's always been pop worth dancing to, but it's been a long time since so many skilled dance music producers have contributed to the cause.– Hattie LindertRecord of the YearOklouchoke enoughThe off‑centre vaporwave pop songs on Oklou's radical debut make for perfect bedroom music. The French musician's hypnagogic dream logic and tender harmonies render life's most existential moments with microscopic precision and a lulling calm. "endless" opens like a beacon from a far‑off village, her dulcet, auto‑tuned vocals shutting out all notifications from the outside world. "thank you for recording" turns surveillance into a lullaby, while "blade bird" crystallises the album's themes of attachment and harm into weightless nursery rhymes. In the background hum of 2025's global crises, this kind of dissociative dream pop feels spot on, turning panic into an exquisitely arranged experience. This is a record for soft clubbing; for dreamers who want the night to blur rather than explode.– Gio SantiagoRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordskeiyaAhooke's lawIt's rare to be transported inside an artist's head. keiyaA's second album is so expressive that listeners can almost hear her neurons crackling as she crafts track after track of achingly intimate music. It's like reading her diary, while also pilfering her drug stash. The Chicago-raised artist translates the chaos of heartbreak, self-doubt, rage and mental illness into a brilliant bricolage of experimental pop and R&B. These 19 cuts are surreal and unsettling, but also raw and truthful, portraying soul music as both escapism and catharsis.– Cameron CookRead the full reviewListen:BandcampPinkPantheressFancy ThatPinkPantheress crashed into 2025 with a mixtape that supercharged the London producer's breakbeat-driven sound. Her recognisable traits—a core palette of UKG, jungle, drum & bass; Y2K-era samples, conversational vocals—remain, but overall, Fancy That is so bold and bright that it feels like a reinvention. Hands-in-the-air moments, faster tempos and peak-time melodies are abundant. With surprise summer hits like the Underworld-sampling "Illegal" and the Groove Armada-inspired "Stateside," the young luminary proved she can go from being an internet star to the leader of club-pop's next generation.– Shaad D'SouzaRead the full reviewListen:SpotifyTracksFKA twigs"Girl Feels Good"Eusexua is all about revelation—the sensation of finding your true self "under a hard metal silver stiletto on the damp rave floor." On "Girl Feels Good," the album's trip-hop highlight, the UK multi-hyphenate celebrates this sentiment with unbridled joy.

"Bite The Bait," produced by regular collaborator Jimmy Edgar, is a late-night R&B jam where the Chicago artist's teasing, honeyed soprano drips over stripped-back drums."Pulled up to the party it was me, myself and I / Breaking hella hearts I didn't even have to try," she sings, radiating a quiet confidence that carries the track right from the club to the afters at dawn.– Katie ThomasListen:BandcampMixbambinodjLIVE FROM EARTH Mix 79If you've fallen for the hazy alt-pop of Oklou or Malibu, you'll find a kindred spirit in bambinodj. His music welds the Black diasporic sounds of shatta, amapiano and Flex Dance Music with trance, ambient and IDM. These aren't genres that a DJ would typically pair, but in bambinodj's world, it makes perfect sense. This mix encapsulates his sonic DNA: downtempo Balearic haze, inscrutable SoundCloud oddities, Caribbean rhythms and majestic piano leads that put Marc Cohn's Walking in Memphis to shame.– Fahad AkinsanyaListen:SoundCloudFurther ListeningSudan ArchivesThe BPMListen:BandcampJim Legxacyblack british music (2025)Listen:BandcampFcukers"Play Me"Listen:BandcampGeorge Riley"Private Life"Listen:SpotifyMalibuUnited In Flames w/ JAMESJAMESJAMESListen:SoundCloudListen to the Neo Electronic Pop playlistSpotify

> Oklouchoke enoughThe off‑centre vaporwave pop songs on Oklou's radical debut make for perfect bedroom music. The French musician's hypnagogic dream logic and tender harmonies render life's most existential moments with microscopic precision and a lulling calm. "endless" opens like a beacon from a far‑off village, her dulcet, auto‑tuned vocals shutting out all notifications from the outside world. "thank you for recording" turns surveillance into a lullaby, while "blade bird" crystallises the album's themes of attachment and harm into weightless nursery rhymes. In the background hum of 2025's global crises, this kind of dissociative dream pop feels spot on, turning panic into an exquisitely arranged experience. This is a record for soft clubbing; for dreamers who want the night to blur rather than explode.– Gio SantiagoRead the full reviewListen:Bandcamp

> keiyaAhooke's lawIt's rare to be transported inside an artist's head. keiyaA's second album is so expressive that listeners can almost hear her neurons crackling as she crafts track after track of achingly intimate music. It's like reading her diary, while also pilfering her drug stash. The Chicago-raised artist translates the chaos of heartbreak, self-doubt, rage and mental illness into a brilliant bricolage of experimental pop and R&B. These 19 cuts are surreal and unsettling, but also raw and truthful, portraying soul music as both escapism and catharsis.– Cameron CookRead the full reviewListen:Bandcamp

> PinkPantheressFancy ThatPinkPantheress crashed into 2025 with a mixtape that supercharged the London producer's breakbeat-driven sound. Her recognisable traits—a core palette of UKG, jungle, drum & bass; Y2K-era samples, conversational vocals—remain, but overall, Fancy That is so bold and bright that it feels like a reinvention. Hands-in-the-air moments, faster tempos and peak-time melodies are abundant. With surprise summer hits like the Underworld-sampling "Illegal" and the Groove Armada-inspired "Stateside," the young luminary proved she can go from being an internet star to the leader of club-pop's next generation.– Shaad D'SouzaRead the full reviewListen:Spotify

> Noise DistortionDance music's edges have frayed in fascinating ways in 2025. Whether an attempt to make sense of a world still vibrating with instability, or simply a rejection of the overpolished club tools that continue to flood the scene, some of the year's best releases have been forged from the cracks—records that find beauty in disintegration.At the centre of this shift is a renewed fascination with noise and distortion, not only as sonic aesthetic but as emotional language. Disparate artists seem to be drawn to sounds that carry strain, abrasion or a sense of dislocation. Distortion communicates pressure—be that in a personal sense or wider communities navigating upheaval. Even when artists such as Los Thuthanaka or aya pushed their palettes into raw or blown-out territory, it was less about harshness for its own sake and more about revealing what lay beneath the polish.Equally, distortion took on a more introspective bent. Producers working in slower or more reflective modes—Klein, DJ Haram, Rainy Miller—leaned into erosion as a kind of emotional texture. Their use of noise suggested memory slipping, feelings blurring, structures softening rather than breaking.While far from a new phenomenon, perhaps this turn toward noise is a response to an era defined by overstimulation. Amid algorithmic smoothness and endless playlists, distortion feels like something human again. It restores the club's physicality: a reminder that dance music has always thrived on what doesn't quite fit, on frequencies that shake your body as much as they move your feet.– Michael LawsonRecord of the YearLos ThuthanakaLos ThuthanakaUnless you experience synesthesia, listening to Los Thuthanaka might be the closest you'll get to seeing sound. Digitised Andean folk music brings to mind brown mountains and deep blue lakes, while corroded synths are redlined to evoke a radioactive lime green. The first collaborative album from siblings Joshua Crampton and Chuquimamani-Condori melds Andean folk, queer psychedelia and staticky ambient into an ultra-digital experience. Crampton's chugging electric guitar provides the bedrock, setting the atmosphere ablaze while Chuquimamani-Condori gets busy with their sampler, adding bursts of humour via cartoonish, pitched-down voices yelling "Yo!" or "Grrrrr!" over sun-dappled rhythms. These crackling loops become heaving, transcendental waves of sound, haptic feedback sent all the way down from their ancestors.– Kiana MicklesRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordsayahexed!Trauma scuffs your spirit, the way an explosion leaves your ears ringing. aya's mesmerising second album seeks to confront her past battles with substance addiction head-on and out loud.

> Guitar JamsRight now, guitars are everywhere in electronic music, a reflection of the great blending of genres that's defined the past five years. In 2025, albums were rarely anchored to one sound, often enlisting the malleable quality of the guitar to transform electronic beats into rock ballads. As one of the oldest instruments, guitars can provoke a jolt of time-worn emotion. That tug on the heart when you hear a lonely minor key? Practically baked into human DNA. Ambling post-rock arpeggios can inspire visions of pastoral terrain, while an indie-pop glissando might give you a new lease of life. Fans clamour to see Smerz's dramatic live rendition of "You got time and I got money," while at home they hit replay for the moping chords that stretch out below the duo's honeyed lyrics.Rock faded out of the mainstream in the late '00s, as EDM, rap and pop surged across the next decade. The genre struggled to reclaim its place in the zeitgeist, until a post-pandemic malaise stalked the music industry and everyone reached for their guitars. Copenhagen—which, in addition to Smerz, is home to Astrid Sonne, ML Buch and Erika de Casier—led the charge. Using the guitar as a textural tool, these artists built layers atop introspective electronic foundations. They bottled a year of political turmoil and economic decline into songs that felt double-sided, capturing a youthful angst alongside a yearning for something, anything, more.– Kiana MicklesRecord of the Yearjames KFriendOn Friend, Jamie Krasner wields her guitar with the freedom of an acrobat flying through the air. Using space to transformative effect, she defies expectations of electronic pop songwriting through her mastery of genre. Wispy tones lap gently against glowing reverbed vocals, bringing an expansive feel to the album's unique strain of ethereality.There's no doubt Krasner can shred in a more classic indie rock vein (see "On God"'s swathes of dream pop chords), but where she really excels is in transforming the guitar altogether through sampling and meticulously applied FX. Whether it's chugging alongside the peppy heartbeat drums on "Play," sputtering over choral vocal samples on the cavernous "Rider" or undulating at the core of trip-hoppy "Blinkmoth (July Mix)," her guitar shapeshifts throughout Friend's electronic landscape as mutably as a synth could.– Sue ParkRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordsAcopiaBlush ResponseAcopia's third album is a shimmering haze of shoegaze guitars and soft, yearning vocals. Moving away from the drum programming and grittier, bass-driven sound of previous records, Blush Response revels in downtempo, sparse grooves and cool-headed trip-hop. Vocalist Kate Durman channels her lilting soubrette over distorted fuzz, reverb-laden guitar tones and the wonky harmonics of tracks like "Chase Me" and "Let Down." The album is a dreamlike, wafting soundworld seen through bleary eyes.– Ammar KaliaRead the full reviewListen:BandcampJoanne RobertsonBlurrrIn a year full of albums that sound like they might have drifted from an abandoned campsite, Blurrr distinguishes itself with the subtle spectrum of sound it teases from everyday tools. The UK musician's guitar groans in her hands as much as it sings, always a low, solid counterweight to her floating and translucent voice. This is an album that envelopes you like mist: slowly, imperceptibly, until all of a sudden it's all you can see.– Sasha GeffenRead the full reviewListen:BandcampTracksSmerz"You got time and I got money"On "You got time and I've got money," Smerz cement their claim to Scandi fame. It's the Copenhagen duo's own "Bittersweet Symphony," an orchestral love song that documents the thrill of a new relationship. Although the track's smoky bass guitar plucks a refrain in D minor sharp—the key of mourning—it still lands as a serene dispatch from the honeymoon phase, all warm embraces and waking up together. Over the smoothest drumline of the year, Catharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt wallow in a grounded romance: patient, consistent and built to endure.– Hattie LindertListen:BandcampNourished By Time"Max Potential"The brazen heart of "Max Potential" is riven: between passion and resignation, romance and staying true to oneself. This standout from Nourished By Time's fantastic second album, The Passionate Ones, establishes a remarkable sweep. The Baltimore singer teases out love's inherent freneticism, while the arrangements shift wildly—a frantic dynamic for frantic times. Eventually, the protean musical sensibility whips the urgent central lyric, "If I'm gonna go insane / At least I'm loved by you," into a mantra for the steadfast and enamoured.

> Club HeatersAt the end of every year, we usually identify a single track that seemed to unite every club and festival stage. Think Maya Jane Coles' "What They Say," Kassem Mosse's "Untitled (A1)" or Joy Orbison's 2024 smash "flight fm," tracks that sliced clean through our imagined trenches and could make any dance floor move in unison.In 2025, it felt like that moment never quite materialised. Don't get us wrong: the absence of a unanimous dance floor heater doesn't mean there wasn't a slew of excellent club music coming out. It's more that the heat got more localised. It's long been true that what goes off in, say, New York, stands apart from what works in Ibiza, and this year, those differences made the notion of a single, standout club anthem untenable.The lack of universal hits, however, meant more breathing room. This year, the producers soundtracking peak-time moments have stayed small, specific and rooted. For the cohort revelling against AI slop, algorithmic sameness and other homogenising forces, the result was a landscape defined by artistic pluralism and local autonomy rather than one-size-fits-all trends.This shift hints at progress. The appetite for hard and fast persists, sure, but it mutated, shaped by space, crowd and context. Instead of one monolithic sound dominating the scene, you get micro-moments: whether that be the Come Round EP by DJ PGZ & Yikes, two Aboriginal producers staking their claim on the sound of Australian dance floors and bush doofs; or Kiara Scuro and Sugar Free, whose respective releases channelled a sleazy, slow-burning chug familiar to anyone who has clocked in hours at fabric or Houghton. A welcome reminder that the notion of peak time can—and should—offer something different for every floor.– Bella AquilinaRecord of the YearDJ PGZ & YikesCome RoundCome Round has the unbridled energy of a peak-time dance floor coursing through it. Gunai/Kurnai and Yorta Yorta artist DJ PGZ and Boorloo-based Wongi artist Yikes forged their bond in underground spaces—from DJ PGZ attending formative queer parties to inviting Yikes to play his first set at Sub Club in Naarm. Here, that early spark comes full circle. Across solo cuts, cross-remixes and a standout joint track, "Ouss Ouss," the release maps two artists searching for, and ultimately locking into, unity in their respective sounds.It's full throttle from the get‑go: all big, wubby basslines, fierce vocal chops and swirling crescendos that summon the kind of feral inhibition only a grimy basement can unlock. DJ PGZ's pulsing hard techno interlocks with Yikes's spacious, trance-leaning grooves, all threaded by percussive broken beats. The result captures a powerful moment, as two First Nations producers propel Australian dance music into its next chapter.– Hannah DoodyListen:BandcampRecordsKiara ScuroNight Crush​​On Kassian's Rinse FM show in February, Rosie Ama described Night Crush, the debut (and final) Kiara Scuro EP, as "an ode to being on the dance floor when you don't really know what time it is." That disoriented thrill runs through all three tracks: the haziness of heavy reverb and the way the deep, rolling grooves lock your body into the rhythm. Every so often, a repeating riff on opener "Witching Hour" invites that movement, murmuring "body, in motion." File this one with your favourite Planet Euphorique releases.– Katie ThomasListen:BandcampSugar FreeDisociandoJust like her DJ sets, Sugar Free's debut EP squirms with amoebic movement. Disociando's prog house and tech house cuts swell and contract like jellyfish in water, balancing moments of hips-swaying bliss with heads-down enthralment. Pared-back drums add tension and a touch of sleaze, while gorgeous textural details—oddball synth burbles and feedback buildups—bring a zany experimentalism into the mix. This striking amalgam of psychedelia, minimal house and bounce is a peak-time treat with grit and groove, but it's also slinky enough to work the afters.– Nyshka ChandranRead the full reviewListen:BandcampTracksWOST"Banda"Not "banda" as in band, but as in crew. This Spanish translation nails the mantra of the global posse that WOST and Colombian label TraTraTrax have been rallying over the years. On "Banda," the Bogotá-based producer unleashes a percussive cut that's travelled from Video Club to Rinse FM. There's FM synthesis, a drum breakdown and a sped-up dembow tresillo beat so syncopated it sounds like it might mutate into dubstep with each bar. As the gap between the Latin American and UK undergrounds keeps closing, "Banda" proves electronic fusion never has to dilute flavour.– Rachel Grace AlmeidaListen:BandcampJump Source"On (feat. Martyn Bootyspoon)"Patrick Holland and Priori have been quietly producing with other artists—like james K and Physical Therapy—from their Montreal studio. They've still had time to crank out earworms like "On," a euphoric club track so infectious it disarms even the most dedicated techno purists. The confluence of Jump Source's meticulous production and Martyn Bootyspoon's signature vocal swagger is a showcase in style that feels both retro-futurist and viscerally current. In a sense, it's the sound of 2025—a reach for nostalgic sounds that sits undeniably in the present.– Chloe LulaListen:BandcampMixDJ Tobzy Imole GiwaLagos City UnloadedThe algorithm demands bitesized clips of DJs blending belters together. You can either curse this tyranny, or do like DJ Tobzy Imole Giwa does and exaggerate the formula. On Lagos City Unloaded, the cruise beat DJ blitzes through hyperspeed pop, R&B and Eurodance alongside continental genres like Afrobeat, kwaito and amapiano. During one flurry, Lil Wayne's famous "A Milli" a capella creeps in with the subtlety of Looney Tunes's Sylvester before being ousted by the Tweety Bird-pitched trill of Yves Larock's "Rise Up." As DJ Tobzy pushes everything he touches to cartoonish extremes, he makes disparate genres find copious common ground.– Joseph FrancisListen:BandcampFurther ListeningBaaltiMelaRead the reviewListen:BandcampPloyIt's Later Than You ThinkRead the reviewListen:BandcampKhadija Al Hanafi"Bounce It On The Flo"Listen:BandcampJSPORT"No Turning Back"Listen:BandcampKontronatura b2b Nick LeónCarnaval Novo AffairListen:SoundCloudListen to the Club Heaters playlistSpotify

### **NONO GIGSTA** - The House of Crocodiles (Live at Freerotation)
> Halfway through Nono Gigsta's sequel to her 2018 Freerotation set, also named The House of Crocodiles, we get an indication of the strange title's origins. "The males' rippling flesh sends soundwaves through the water… humans can barely hear them, but the crocodiles can. Welcome to the House of Crocodiles," a sample narrates. And then, oh so naturally, it moves into a roaring electric guitar solo (Led Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love"). It's a bonkers move that can prompt you to completely rethink what DJing can be. It's also completely natural in the hands of the Belgian DJ.Jaw-dropping transitions dominate this two-hour recording, aptly described as "Big Blend Academy" by one commenter. Low-end frequencies anchor the mix as it darts through wild variations in mood and tempo. Dubwise experiments (LUXE's "Diamond Dub") morph into frenetic jazz techno (Gigi FM's "Gabriella"), sounding like DJ Sprinkles if she dabbled in UK bass. You can feel Gigsta's sense of freedom as she aqueously glides across loose and liquid rhythms.Freewheeling mixes of this sort often risk being overly headsy, but this is a very fun listen that spans Björk, Foster Sylvers and Victoria Monet. The inclusion of more "popular music" only adds to the overwhelming sense of feverish delight. There's only one reasonable response to a mix this audacious: "WTF." - Bella Aquilina

### **Chucheewa** - Sound Metaphors (Refuge Worldwide)
> Chucheewa, one-half of Bangkok duo Acid Sister, thrives in slow tempos where she can flex her storytelling skills. In this mix, she's the sonic embodiment of an off-duty femme fatale. Balearic downtempo, acid house, dubby disco and woozy krautrock criss-cross one another like whispery marble veins, transporting listeners to a sleek, '70s-style disco where our protagonist is getting her lounge on. There's a nonchalant swagger underlining every track, as if mirroring her breezy movements. The mood is loose-limbed but there's a high degree of intellect and intention behind each rhythm, just like a Bond girl's alluringly sharp demeanour. - Nyshka Chandran

### **JADALAREIGN** - Episode 65 (There Is No Planet Earth)
> For Black History Month, New York's JADALAREIGN explored the myriad shades of deep house through a futurist lens. Selections emphasise the radical spirit behind Black music-making, whether via icy, austere melodies or the psychedelic squelches of 303s. Cruising through under-the-radar classics (Felix Da Housecat's "Free Love") and curveballs (Sweater on Polo's "Computer Controlled Madness"), the Nowadays booker zones in on tunes with a spacey touch that often borders on kooky (just look at Marcus Mixx's twisted jack track "Salut The Noize With A Laugh"). This is a concise but essential glimpse into the innovative imaginations of Chicago and Detroit artists, past and present. - Nyshka Chandran

### **Mia Koden** - One Hour of IICON (FMB Mixtape 243)
> If you caught our Glastonbury recap from earlier this year, you'll already know that Mia Koden's opening set at the IICON stage was something special. A "blend of celestial, 2562-esque dubstep backdropped by a beautiful sunset," as one RA staffer put it. For FMB, the London-based artist condensed that two-and-a-half-hour set into this lean power-hour of soulful sub-pressure. Just listen to the way she moves from the soothing resplendence of Ella Fitzgerald to the dank 140 of Slimy, Delta and Obskure within the opening ten minutes. Anything's possible in Mia Koden's capable hands. - Tom Gledhill

### **Priori** - Dekmantel Podcast 459 
> 2024 was a career-defining year for Canadian DJ and producer Priori, whose entry into the vaunted Dekmantel series blooms with spiralling, psychedelia-dipped sound design. This 90-minute session bears more resemblance to a longform song than a tapestry of different ones, applying incredible attention to detail by collaging deep and squelchy textures that sit as much in the future as they do in the past. If a snapshot could be taken of the styles that reigned 2024's dance floors, it's this: an incredibly cohesive and soft-hued marriage of nimble breakbeats, techno and trance from an artist going from strength to strength. - Chloe Lula

### **Reptant** - Floresta (Live at Waking Life)
> The appeal of a festival lies in its promise of escape from the mundane, and there's perhaps no better soundtrack to this promise than Reptant. A key figure in the electro revival, the Melbourne producer is known for a sleek, omnivorous sound that blends elements of tech house, trance and techno. His powers shine in this live recording from Portugal's Waking Life festival, which brims with otherworldly ambience. One standout at the 22-minute mark sounds as if Mike Skinner and Plastikman made an electro record together. Reptant later called it his "most special" gig ever. Check the SoundCloud comments and you'll see the dancers agree. - Bella Aquilina

### **DJ Swisha** - The Lot × Kiosk (Live at Horst)
> DJ SWISHA is currently operating at the peak of his powers. With a doctorate-level grasp of Black American dance music and UK breakbeat, he's a true mixologist with a PhD in tearing up the club. This recording proves it. Effortlessly weaving through East Coast club, ghetto house, jungle and footwork, there's an enviable ease to every blend. The feral crowd noise is the perfect cherry on top—each transition is met with unrestrained whoops and cheers. Aspiring club DJs, take notes: this is a masterclass in how it's done. - Fahad Akinsanya

### **Toumba** - FACT mix 938 
> Full disclosure: this one actually landed in December 2023. But because it slipped through the cracks of year-end coverage, and the legendary mix series shut down weeks later, we decided to bend the rules. Plus, it's totally mesmerising, the kind of mix that triggers 1,000 wormholes and—should you listen in a particularly fragile state—possibly floods of tears. This is bold, cinematic, heart-on-sleeve DJing. A long ambient first half features tracks from Ulla, Burial and Slikback before morphing into headbanging mode with shards of Verraco, Eartheater and Lil Wayne. Stick this on when you really want to feel something. - Carlos Hawthorn

### **DJ Travella** - Live at Draaimolen Festival 
> DJ Travella is the face of singeli's future. The Dar Es Salaam artist infuses techno and taarab into the famously hi-NRG genre, adding a touch of experimentalism and contemporary rave to its frenzied tempos. For many in attendance, this was a clear highlight of Draaimolen Festival and it's easy to understand why. His vibrant selections possess a sense of urgency, commanding movement through jolting synths and madcap effects. The crowd vibed so hard that Travella ended up dancing on top of the decks—a perfect picture of singeli's joyful nature. - Nyshka Chandran

### **YAJAIRA LA BEYACA & GENOSIDRA** - Misantropical (Rinse France)
> Three things are guaranteed when these two subversive powerhouses link up: an onslaught of Latin-infused bass trax, coquettish flexes about diva behaviour and an involuntary desire to throw ass. Venezuelan rave doll Yajaira La Beyaca has been on a tear since 2021, but this hybrid live set—one of her first in Europe—alongside frequent collaborator Genosidra, demonstrates an artist fully stepping into her powers. Darting through apocalyptic perreo, guaracha and what some call Latincore, this session is a soundtrack for all your freaky pre-club rituals. When Genosidra slips into a speed dembow refix of JME's "If You Don't Know"? Proof that perfection does exist. - Rachel Grace Almeida

## [The Best Tracks of 2024](https://ra.co/features/4401)
Date: 2024-12-04T12:45:45.000Z

### **DJ Love** - Bomb Tech 49 (Eastern Margins)
> Like gqom and raptor house, budots is finally joining the modest list of regional dance music genres gaining global recognition. Originating in the Philippines in the early '00s, the street-pioneered sound combines trancey techno and house with fat bass, high-pitched synths and lots of air horns.Now, pioneer DJ Love is showing off a new mutation of the classic sound with "Bomb Tech 49." Fittingly called bomb-tek, this offshoot is more techno-driven and undeniably harder, darker and leaner. Whereas the traditional stylings tend to be chirpier and whimsical, blippy effects, this strain, full of springy basslines and looped drums, takes budots off the streets and into the club. - Nyshka Chandran

### **Nuovo Testamento** - In My Dreams (Powerhouse Mix) (Eskimo/N.E.W.S.)
> "In My Dreams (Powerhouse Mix)" is the early '90s Italo house classic that never was. Pairing sugary, Latin freestyle-inspired vocals with huge piano stabs à la 4 For Money's "It's a Moment in Time," it's the kind of turn-of-the-decade anthem you'd expect to hear soundtracking grainy archival footage from Cocoricò or Quadrant Park.Except "In My Dreams" isn't from the '90s—it's a new release from contemporary synth pop outfit Nuovo Testamento. Dismiss it as frivolous if you like, but doing so won't diminish the truth: this track is custom-made for massive, life-affirming rave moments. - Michael Lawson

### **Sam Goku** - Temple Arp (Dekmantel)
> Like many great techno tracks, "Temple Arp" is a marathon, not a sprint. Stretching out over seven minutes, this beatific roller hooks you in with a cosmic intro that builds tension like a thriller. Sam Goku's previous releases, such as 2021's Tanggu and 2021's East Dimensional Riddims, have demonstrated the Munich-based producer's eye for the finer details."Temple Arp" is the stunning zenith of this meticulous approach: softly padded kicks and constellations of otherworldly synths work seamlessly to lull you into a trance, plotting a dubby voyage of epic proportions that favours nuance over heft. - April Clare Welsh

### **Leonce** - Not Here For It (Morph Tracks)
> It's one thing to produce a dance track. It's quite another to permeate it with the sheer essence of the club, transporting listeners to the dankest dance floor they've ever been on. Atlanta-based producer Leonce's incandescent banger "Not Here For It" uses effervescent keyboard arpeggios and infectious diva vocal samples ("here, here for you") to convey bodily liberation on a visceral level.When the beat drops, you can almost feel the sweat bead on your brow, as Leonce flexes not only his production chops, but his keen understanding of what makes the most seasoned ravers go off. - Cameron Cook

### **TAAHLIAH & Elouiza** - Boys (untitled (recs))
> Nothing hits like a sexy a cappella line—and TAAHLIAH and singer Elouiza delivered on "Boys." Fans of TAAHLIAH's bolshy, playful DJ sets may have been surprised by the introspection of her debut LP, Gramarye, but TAAHLIAH still made room for "Boys," the glossy, seductive club cut she's been teasing since 2022.Elouiza's smouldering vocal—"These boys, they all want me / They all want to get in me"—is adorned with a growling bassline, crashing kick drums and plasticky neon synths, resulting in a perfect balance of cheeky yet tough. If 2024 served us up a track for stomping around the city feeling hot, this is it. - Katie Thomas

### **1OO1O** - Del Salsódromo al Rave (self-released)
> What happens when you throw "Talento de Televisión" by salsa legend Willie Colón into a blender with Nightcrawlers' '90s house anthem "Push the Feeling On"? Possibly the most fun you can have on a dance floor.Mexican producer 1OO1O has been steadily ascending with his tropi-fusions of salsa and breaks, expertly folding the Caribbean genre's rhythmic principles into techno and bass music—all with a puckish wink. But "Del Salsódromo al Rave" takes this formula and intensifies the flavour. A base layer of Nightcrawlers' immediately recognisable synth line, a dash of Colón's warming trumpet ensemble, all bound by pummelling, hip-vitalising kicks at 150 BPM. Delicioso. - Rachel Grace Almeida

### **INVT & Introspekt** - Seismic Activity (ec2a)
> The global club music cross-pollination was in full flow long before Miami duo INVT and neo-garage innovator Introspekt decided to make music together, but the resulting EP, Tectónica, is nevertheless one of the explosive statements in recent memory.It's a quality three-tracker, but opening cut "Seismic Activity" is the one that truly stands out as the jewel in the crown. The trio find a rousing middle ground between their respective styles of Latin-fortified tech house and buoyant UKG, enhanced by a slowed-down sample from Salt-N-Pepa's "Push It." This is dark and lusty 2-step capable of, well, shattering dance floors the world over. - Michael Lawson

### **HiTech** - SPANK! (Loma Vista)
> HiTech know how to keep cool under pressure. This is key to the trio's marriage of heart-palpitating ghettotech with laid-back rapping: their ability to float atop 150 BPM sizzlers with pure control. "SPANK!" pushes that contrast to the max, overlaying a dizzying central bongo loop with programmed keys, synth flares and laser FX.But it runs on GDMRW and King Milo's verses, traded off drill-style in attempts at getting their hands on a triple threat: "She got beauty / She got brains / She got booty all in that thang." Sure, "bend it over, let me spank," isn't the subtlest come-on, but HiTech's flow makes it seem almost elegant. The end result is as sexy and tactile as the palm-to-ass communion. - Hattie Lindert

### **Claire Rousay & Lala Lala** - please 5 more minutes (Thrill Jockey)
> There is an inherent melancholy in having to ask for more time; an underlying sense of defeat in prolonging the inevitable. And though experimental composer Claire Rousay is not above having to “beg” for it, as she candidly croons on electronic ballad “please 5 more minutes”—a standout from this year's sentiment—she wrings clear-eyed dignity out of an act of vulnerability.Combining purposeful guitar with heavily Auto-Tuned vocals, Rousay modifies the self-described "emo ambient" textures of her early work into a cyber-folk vignette that pierces your heart and subverts your ear. Its emotional clarity is overwhelming; the track abandons words for a climax of hymnal chords which slowly fade into a denouement of silence. Time, as it must, has run out. - Jake Indiana

### **Joker** - Juggernaut (Kapsize)
> 2024 was filled to the brim with throwbacks to that foggy period in the late '00s when dubstep was being transformed. This British bass revival also meant that when Joker dropped a 140 BPM monster, he'd arguably never sounded more contemporary. "Juggernaut" is classic Joker: ethereal strings and anthemic horns twist over sparse drum programming and distorted bass so nasty it could make Howard Stern blush.What keeps "Juggernaut" from being a nostalgic victory lap is how he turns everything up to 11. He's had big drops before, but nothing as gargantuan as the lift-off a minute into "Juggernaut." This is "Tron" for a whole new generation. - Henry Ivry

### **Moktar & Saad El Soghayar** - Haraka حركة (Astral People)
> "Haraka حركة" is a monumental convergence between Moktar and Egyptian Mahraganat luminary Saad El Soghayar. Translating to "movement" in Arabic, the track is a unique and powerful meeting point of two street-born genres that embody celebration, cultural resistance and community. Moktar has weaved El Soghayar's wedding anthem into a tapestry of traditional darbuka rhythms and drum & bass, creating a rhythmically rich dialogue of tension and release.Moktar has managed to span meridians, creating a knockout that echoes the venn diagram of heritage and contemporary dance music. From Cairo's DIY block parties to London's pirate radio, "Haraka حركة" is a testament to how the underground has always spoken the same language, no matter where it calls home. - Ramsey Tawil

### **Tinashe** - Nasty (Tinashe Music/Nice Life)
> Janet Jackson owns the word "Nasty." But you know what? The economy's rough. You can forgive her—even thank her—for leasing it out to Tinashe, who didn't take on stewardship of the word lightly.Tinashe's "Nasty" is both an impeccable Janet tribute—minimal, casual and freaky in all the right places—and a marker of what you can achieve if you tell the major label pop ecosystem to do one and chart your own path instead. It's the kind of song that seems forgettable at first listen and totally indispensable by your third, in part because it's so confident. Unlike so much pop this year, "Nasty" is so unbothered about proving itself to you that it's easy to dismiss at first glance, even as its rubbery bassline and off-kilter vocal samples build and build. Dismiss it at your peril. - Shaad D'Souza

### **Carré** - Fawn (SPE:C)
> Los Angeles bass enthusiast Carré elevated her skills in the studio this year. Following stellar releases on Beatrice M.'s Bait and Fast at Work, Air Sign EP was the standout. Sandwiched between a pair of heavier bangers, its comparatively low-key B-side, "Fawn," is a masterful distillation of her signature technoid dubstep. Moving at a subtly brisker clip than traditional 140, the track's bass pulses, spiralling vocals and dubbed-out drums shift and cycle, evoking the earth-rattling march of a giant.After 80 seconds of moody table-setting, a playful series of plucks erupts seemingly from nowhere, skipping up and down in pitch. Then, as quickly as it arrived, this cute riff is gone, displaying Carré's deft control over arrangement. For anyone curious about dark and minimal dubstep's evolution over the past decade, this is the place to start. - Tom Gledhill

### **Kim Gordon** - BYE BYE (Matador)
> Kim Gordon landed the coldest industrial trap record of 2024, you say? Why not. Where earlier instances of the downtown icon fringing electronic music were speckled in hiss—see Ciccone Youth's insouciant Madonna flip "Into The Groovey" or far-out noise excursions with illbient pioneer DJ Olive—"BYE BYE" is incredibly forthright.It's loud, both in the offhand banality of Kim Gordon rapping a pre-trip checklist (turtleneck, milk thistle, vibrator), as well as the collision of synth stabs, abrasive guitars and a beat that knocks like a cinder block to the head. Gordon can evidently sell anything. And if you figure the former frontwoman of Sonic Youth has no business being on an RA end-of-year list, well, I can think of two words she might use to bid that sentiment adieu too. - Gabriel Szatan

### **Mk.gee** - Breakthespell (R&R)
> If we're being honest, part of Mk.gee's appeal is that you can't understand a word he's saying. Throughout his dazzling debut album, Two Star & the Dream Police, the New Jersey-born artist's warbled vocals are at points barely decipherable—prioritising atmosphere over precision, which cloaks his music in a quixotic, almost Jai Paul-ish mist.On "Breakthespell," his voice melts into the heavily delayed guitars and billowing synths he's become known for. Once you finally manage to decode lyrics, they only heighten the hazy ambience, as he anguishedly calls out: "I can't win / And I won't end." The agent of his heartbreak is unclear; although if the song title offers any hints, it might even be Mk.gee himself. "Breakthespell" may not provide clarity, but it doesn't matter—this is the sound of catharsis. - Bella Aquilina

### **Charisse C & DJ Kwamzy** - Morning Sun (Abantu)
> It was almost inevitable that Charisse C, one of the UK's leading ambassadors for amapiano, would eventually step out from behind the decks and into the vocal booth. "Morning Sun" is her bright take on the beloved genre, buoyed by airy vocals that create a sense of spiritual peace. But those sparkling notes soon transform into a moody dance floor heater, channelling the irresistible drama of amapiano and 3-step's percussive patterns.With Kwamzy on the assist, the pair created a hybrid anthem that represents the vibrant sounds of contemporary South African dance music. As well as being an excellent entry into the canon, "Morning Sun" represents Charisse C's natural progression from DJ to fully rounded artist—and she makes it look effortless. - Jesse Bernard

### **Mica Levi** - slob air (Hyperdub)
> You never know what to expect from South London composer Mica Levi. Their last solo record, 2021's Blue Alibi, was a spiky, lo-fi grunge affair, while their score for Jonathan Glazer’s 2023 chilling film The Zone of Interest unleashed nightmares through experimental found sound.This summer, Levi once again opted for unpredictability with their Hyperdub debut, the 12-minute dream pop epic hypnotically circles around a loop of undulating synths, a rumbling bass hum and an assertive, locked-in beat. Occasionally, the transcendental melody is interrupted by a slight key change or the growing swell of indecipherable voices, but it's never enough to unseat the song's steady, meditative pace. "slob air" is like watching the sun rise on the top deck of the bus after a bleary night out—life-affirming. - Steph Philips

### **Thoughtforms** - Tubes (Thoughtforms)
> Uruguayan artist Fernando Zapico, AKA Z@P, has been steadily drip-feeding low-slung, acid tech house into the catalogues of niche labels for years. Now, his endeavours have culminated on Red, a statement of intent on own imprint. The EP's sharpest cut, "Tubes," features a classic proggy synth line that syphons off inspiration from techno, electro and wave, intertwining pulsing synths with metallic rhythms that pitter-patter across the four-four grid.While the rest of the EP nods towards some of the nostalgic signifiers defining today's zeitgeist—consider the mesmeric bounce of Kalahari Oyster Cult's output—"Tubes"' insatiable groove is the real winner. It's easy to imagine it ripping at the height of a raucous party, the crowd swaying to its heaving beat. - Chloe Lula

### **FKA twigs** - Eusexua (Young)
> In 2024, pop stars shaped culture not only through their art, but by outright defining social mores and public behaviour. Tinashe's "Nasty" allowed an anxiety-ridden generation having less casual sex to try on a slutty persona and Charli xcx's carefree BRAT paved a green road from the club to the Vice President's office.As the sun began to set on late summer, avant-pop visionary FKA twigs also chimed in with the sultry mystique of "Eusexua," the title track from her forthcoming album. While muted techno kicks thump in the distance, the song immediately introduces us not only to a feeling (which twigs describes as "the pinnacle of human experience"), but also an entire cinematic universe full of alien tattoos, silver statement jewellery, seven-inch Pleasers and sheer lingerie. twigs has always sung around the dance floor's periphery, but on "Eusexua," she's never sounded so sure of her place in the heart of the club. - Kiana Mickles

### **RHR & Logan_OLM** - Diagonal (Dub Mix) (Nice & Deadly)
> It's almost too easy to make a club incinerator with Logan_olm on the mic. The London MC has proven time and again that his fierce flows can dominate any beat. In 2024, he met his match in São Paulo funk export RHR, who spent years observing the UK scene from almost 6,000 miles away, fusing his learnings with Brazil's diasporic rhythms. So when he finally got in the ring with Logan, what was the result?The pair's rowdy team-up, "Diagonal (Dub Mix)," vaults straight out the blocks with disorientating sample chops and a chest-caving rumble, laying the perfect foundation for the MC's righteous assertions of his own ability to storm onto any track and make himself heard. Stomping bass that slips off its axis; flecks of flanged synth; percussion that reaches for tamborzão—it's a whirlwind of energy. "Diagonal (Dub Mix)" is the sound of São Paulo and London colliding spectacularly. - Nathan Evans

### **Joy Orbison** - flight fm (Hinge Finger)
> There's always one: doggedly ubiquitous, memed halfway to oblivion, the international overplayers' anthem. Our answer came in record time this year, after "flight fm" landed on January 17th and confirmed that Overmono's Dobermanns would be treated to 12 months of much needed R&R. Dance floors haven't exactly been light on wallopers cribbing their sub action from darkside jungle and speed garage lately, so to understand why "flight fm" went supernova, it's worth paying attention to what the song doesn't do."flight fm" is no-nonsense enough to make the track it might be modelled on, Si Begg's "Revolution No 1," sound positively cluttered. A dainty pre-tremor, some skippy drums and that enormous, grungy bassline—done. Incredibly effective. Vast pockets of negative space compelled others to fill in the blanks, which is why everyone from ropey TikTok remixers to Future and even The Chainsmokers (yes, seriously) mobbed in. What Joy O understands more than most is that a killer hook only represents half the battle. You still need the nous to clear everything else out the way and let it roll. - Gabriel Szatan

### **Snakeskin** - Waiting (Mais Um)
> Snakeskin's second album, They Kept Out Photographs, reflects on a tumultuous year in Lebanon, fuelled by a sense of anger, melancholy and defiance. Its pièce de résistance is the ominous and introspective "Waiting," which features one half of the duo, Julia Sabra, reciting an excerpt from Lebanese poet Etel Adnan's To Be in a Time of War. The words, profoundly poignant on their own, transform simple ongoings of daily life into acts of resistance during wartime.Paired with strong drums, the track opens with an eerie beat reminiscent of a church bell or a loud clock tolling the arrival of doomsday. The combination of Sabra's gradually distorting voice, the increasingly aggressive rhythm and almost mundane lyrics is deeply hypnotic, immersing us in Snakeskin's alternate reality. Yet, like a silver lining amid the heaviness, chimes add a subtle brightness, hinting at the resilience that quietly endures beneath the agony of living through destruction. - Tamara Saade

### **Objekt** - Ganzfeld (Djrum Remix) (Kapsela)
> Djrum vs. Objekt? The nerds were salivating. Djrum vs. Objekt on "Ganzfeld"? Tongues were practically on the floor. The ten-minute odyssey gets the gong for the year's glitchiest anthem, shapeshifting its way through tender piano, Syro-style turbulence and half-time freakouts with an exhilarating level of detail and unpredictability."Giving something a completely new context is, in some ways, the name of the game," Djrum recently told RA. He was talking about DJing, but you can tell he applied the same philosophy to this remix, transforming Objekt's much loved electro classic into a swarm of breakbeats and squiggly left turns. Few could have nailed it so hard. - Carlos Hawthorn

### **James K** - Blinkmoth (July Mix) (AD 93)
> This year, no artist has made downtempo more appealing than New York producer James K, whose breathy, lilting vocals have floated across some of 2024's best music. It makes sense that amid sustained geo-political violence and economic turbulence, we'd again find solace in shoegaze—music that slows the anxious heart while holding a mirror to deep-rooted angst we prefer to leave unspoken."Blinkmoth (July Mix)" commanded repeat listens this year for an instantaneous pull that sucks you into the muted vortex of James K's romantic solitude. As she sings about the endless transference of love, a trip-hop beat glides and gallops, tactfully situating us in the '90s. But really, it's the heavenly vocals that we're here for. Her delivery glistens with the Elizabeth Fraser effect: carried foremost by feeling, the curvature of her indecipherable lyrics capture the fleeting moment in which euphoria sinks into quiet melancholy. Additions like this to the electronic shoegaze revival should give any non-believer proof of its enduring relevance. - Kiana Mickles

### **Nick León & Erika de Casier** - Bikini (TraTraTrax)
> A great pop song is like a charm: compact and entrancing, a daydream corked and uncorked at will. If it can't guarantee good fortune, it can at least transport a listener somewhere they feel lucky to be. And no song in 2024 made as great an escape as Nick León and Erika de Casier's "Bikini.""It leaks into the music somehow," León said earlier this month of growing up by the ocean. The Miami native describes his compositions as spaces to inhabit rather than stories; a personal stamp strong enough to transform any output he lends his hand to, be that ambient (Gloria) or perreo heaters (Rompediskoteka). De Casier wields similar scene-setting skills: she wrote one of 2023's stickiest earworms, New Jeans' "Super Shy," without ever sacrificing her signature delicate style presented to perfection on 2019 breakout album, Essentials.An anthem like "Bikini" was always on the cards for the pair: their last collaboration, the Dionysian "Ex-Girlfriend" with SHYGIRL, nailed the body-first composition of Nelly Furtado and Timbaland's best work. Harp-like keyboard notes pierce the clip of a bassline, plunging into deep dembow as elegantly as four-on-the-floor. Embracing de Casier's crystalline mezzo-soprano, "Bikini" pushes sound into pure sensation: sand between toes and lips on goose-pimpled skin. When she was a teenager, "going to the swimming pool was the worst thing I could imagine," she told Mixmag in 2021. A decade-plus later, "Bikini" comes alive in the shedding of those inhibitions: why hedge around the pool, when you could head straight for the sea?Despite "Bikini"'s deft movement between shifting rhythmic patterns, the track still manages to capture a profound sense of pause. Trying to make sense of the changing tides—"Lookin' out there / Tryin' to find a meaning"—de Casier only finds herself recentered "with the wind in my hair, just breathing in the air." It's these atmospheric tendencies that take "Bikini" from the track of September to the track of the year. Before León and de Casier, artists from Otis Redding to Kelela have gazed "out there," hoping to find some sort of solace in the meeting of water and sky. And in a year so rife with misery, there are plenty of reasons to be fearful for the future. But "Bikini" charts a different course—it's a three-minute appeal to just be. - Hattie Lindert

## [The Best Records of 2024](https://ra.co/features/4404)
Date: 2024-12-03T11:05:14.000Z

### **British Murder Boys** - Active Agents and House Boys (downwards)
> Surgeon and Regis have been creating industrial anthems as British Murder Boys for more than two decades. Individually, they're synonymous with taut, stripped back dance floor grooves that close a circle between musique concrète and steel-toed techno. But when they come together, their output is raw and unbridled, channelling the punk lineage of Coil, Suicide and Throbbing Gristle.Indeed, their debut LP, Active Agents and House Boys, is fundamentally live-sounding, its distorted kicks and walls of resonant feedback grinding like unoiled gears. Yet the music's embrace of funk and even melody — a new string to their bow—underlines the duo's conviction that serious music doesn't have to take itself so seriously. - Chloe Lula

### **Regal86** - Unearthed Vol.II*100 Trax* (self-released)
> 100 tunes. Let that sink in for a second. One hundred. The craziest thing? Unearthed Vol. II *100 Trax* isn't even a slog. In fact, these bitesize jams slide down like a fresh cocktail—all zinger, no filler.Regal86's exquisite drum work, crafty sampling and smoky sound palette coat the vast Bandcamp dump in a marked soulfulness. Even more impressive, he's no one-trick pony: the Monterrey producer is just as adept slinging out dubby ambient techno ("Deep Forest") and slamming hip-hop ("Quiero que sepan") as euphoric hardcore ("Fades") and the hardgroove ("Baby Phat Jacket") he built his name on. Honestly, it's all so good. All of it. - Carlos Hawthorn

### **Jlin** - Akoma (Planet Mu)
> The first thing Jlin fans will notice on her third album, Akoma, is that the producer and composer's idol, Philip Glass, has added his famous arpeggios. Avant-garde queen Björk and contemporary ensemble Kronos Quartet also impressively made the roster.These features hint at the direction Jlin, who has gone from inventive footwork producer to unruly experimental composer, has taken over the years. "Eye Am"'s jubilant hand drums find more common ground with traditional African drumming, whereas "Summon" creates tension with a torrent of piercing strings. Rest assured, though, one listen to the plinky keys and juddering rhythms on "Grannie's Cherry Pie" confirms that this is still music that will spring dancers and footworkers into action. - Kiana Mickles

### **Nourished By Time** - Catching Chickens EP (Nourished By Time)
> Nourished by Time makes double-take music. When you first hear Marcus Brown's hypnagogic R&B anthems, you almost can't believe someone is going that hard. His songs, which gesture towards the spiritual truths underpinning quotidian tasks, are imbued with a life-or-death urgency by his stentorian baritone alone.Following 2023's breakout Erotic Probiotic 2, Catching Chickens sees Brown stretching out stylistically, exploring shoegaze guitars ("Poison-Soaked"), funhouse synth solos ("Had Ya Called") and classic nightclub crooning ("Romance in Me"). But it's the massive opener, "Hell of a Ride," that keeps us coming back. With its airy chorus, galloping beat and infectious "goodbye baby, goodbye" refrain, you can envisage Brown speeding off into yet uncharted territory. - Matt McDermott

### **Nala Sinephro** - Endlessness (Warp)
> It can be tough for a rising artist to follow up a spectacular album. Nala Sinephro's sublime debut, Space 1.8, mesmerised listeners in 2021 for its soul-stirring marriage of ambient and spiritual jazz. Three years later, the London-based harpist and modular synthesist returned with a second LP that dives deeper into restorative sounds.As its title implies, Endlessness feels like an infinite moment in time, suspended by languorous synth arpeggios and hushed sax runs. While some jazz fans prefer the dynamism of its predecessor, the beauty of Endlessness lies in its quietude. Sit back and soak up its ambrosial chords. - Nyshka Chandran

### **Midland** - Fragments of Us (Graded)
> Midland's long-awaited debut album, Fragments of Us, is a moving document of queer heritage, from the peak of the AIDS crisis and institution of the UK's discriminatory Section 28 legislation to the utopian dreaming of artists like Stereogamus' Jonny Seymour and clubs like NYC Downlow.The record is a collection of moody and overcast downtempo songs, in which Midland's poignant yet glittering arpeggios and skittering drums commune with queer voices, past and present. But as much as it's an interrogation of the violence that has engulfed queer public life, Fragments of Us is also a celebration—just wait for those life-affirming strings on "Chapter 10." - Henry Ivry

### **Total Blue** - Total Blue (Music From Memory)
> What do you picture when you think of the Los Angeles skyline? Maybe it's a haze of hot air, twinkling lights at night or how the city seems to stretch as far as the eye can see. It's that topography and atmosphere that Angeleno trio Total Blue wanted to replicate on their debut LP.They succeeded with gusto: the record is a gentle, meandering excursion through expansive ambient textures, New Age jazz experimentations and lush vintage melodies that recall noirish film scenes where the protagonist drives through Beverly Hills, totally unburdened by the downward pressures of life. A stunning escape. - Katie Thomas

### **gum.mp3** - Black Life, Red Planet (Gum Studio)
> gum.mp3 is that all-too-rare artist making smart music you can still go stupid to. The Baltimore-based producer and eldiaNYC crew member's latest offering, Black Life, Red Planet, is a studied yet unfussy expedition through house and jungle, woven with threads of blues, funk and trap."Knowingness" shakes the dust from a swampy blues riff; on "Deimos," a red herring flamenco loop gives way to dembow that could be played via a didgeridoo. "Believe," co-produced with Detroit juke master swoozydolphin, might be the first ambient soundbath with a breakbeat. gum.mp3 creates a common home for radical creative traditions too often siloed—it's one of the most innovative projects of the year. - Hattie Lindert

### **Tim Reaper & Kloke** - In Full Effect (Hyperdub)
> It's hard to believe it took this long for Tim Reaper to release a full-length album. Same goes for agenda-setting label Hyperdub, which, before In Full Effect, had never released a jungle LP. Luckily, Reaper and Naarm (Melbourne) producer Kloke linked up to do the honours, whisking different flavours of early '90s breakbeat into something that transcends the all-too-comfortable pastiche of revivalism.They masterfully reimagine what jungle's trajectory would've looked like had it gone on uninterrupted from its ragga era, with propulsive drum programming and emotional atmospherics serving as the project's anchor. Evocative and trance-inducing, In Full Effect has only solidified jungle's enduring versatility. - Emeka Okonkwo

### **Tyla** - Tyla (FAX/Epic)
> It all started with "Water." In 2023, South African pop powerhouse Tyla's refreshing R&B single launched her into global stardom—and even kicked off a millions-strong TikTok dance craze. This year's self-titled debut album builds on that momentum with a carefully balanced work that's as exciting as it is soulful, as assured as it is vulnerable.Infused with pop, Afrobeats and polished amapiano log drums, the LP is a potent reflection of the various global musical cultures that raised Tyla. Her thoughts on her own identity may have sparked social media discourse, but she stood firm in her truth, dog-walking doubters all the way to the GRAMMYs. - Shiba Melissa Mazaza

### **Various Artists** - Sky Is The Limit (Love on the Rocks)
> Love On The Rocks' catalogue oozes fun and whimsy. On this ten-year compilation, PARAMIDA gathered label regulars (Massimiliano Pagliara, Fantastic Man) and newbies (Sweely, E-Talking) to curate a record capturing the label's exuberant palette of colour and feeling—think trancey synths, progressive grooves, wriggling 303s, dreamy melodies and pumping house rhythms.The frivolity is loudest in the bounce of Alex Kassian & Running Hot's closer "The Love Theme," which gleefully samples Haddaway's 1993 chart-topper "What Is Love." Toasting to a decade via a gleaming eight tracks is a confident missive. Some may say the compilation leans towards "guilty pleasure." To that, we say: there's no such thing—it's just pleasure. - Katie Thomas

### **Skee Mask** - ISS010 (Ilian Tape)
> ISS010 strikes a chord with both factions of Skee Mask's fan base: the production nerds and the DJ set devotees. For the heads, it delivers his signature package of intricately layered sound design, dense percussion, and a wash of echo and reverb. But this time, the DJ devotees get their due as well. ISS010 marks a shift from Skee Mask’s breakbeat explorations to a more dance floor-focused sound, reflecting the heavily house and techno-infused energy of his current DJ sets. The seven-tracker blends syncopated rhythms with gorgeous melodies, weaving flashes of dubstep and ambient textures into rave-ready form. Grime-indebted beats on tracks like “The Bills” could as readily host an MC as send a Detroit loft party into overdrive, while “Double Standard” combines shimmering synths with propulsive drums, making it well suited for introspective home listening or peak-time club play. In a major year for Skee Mask, ISS010 was a record that engaged both body and soul. - Fahad Akinsanya

### **CCL & Ciel** - Tilda's Goat Stare (NAFF)
> CCL and Ciel are a natural fit. Not only because of the DJ-producer pair's enduring friendship, but their shared affinity for journeying through the psychedelic end of the rave spectrum, from proggy doof bangers to swampy downtempo.The unruly title track on their powerful joint EP lights the path to a portal filled with bass pressure and dialogue sampled from Tilda Swinton's 2002 film Teknolust (with an acid-spiked Priori remix to boot). "Goblin Mode" burrows into a subterranean network of synth gurgles and menacing hoover, while "Spiral Drive" sounds like a cyborg reaching for a higher state of consciousness. Who else could melt a feminist sci-fi film into chemistry-altering club trax? - April Clare Welsh

### **Various Artists** - Letters to a Future Palestine (Umay)
> The first compilation on Nene H's UMAY label is a proud display of musical and political unity. Featuring an array of artists and allies from across the Palestinian and SWANA diaspora—ranging from Muskila and KETTALYNNE to Estoc and rRoxymore—Letters to a Future Palestine's 19 tracks are a collective call for solidarity.Traditional drum loops reworked for the rave ("Arish") and powerful Arabic vocal passages ("TARWIDA") build on the sense of ritual and communion, while disjointed breaks accompany eerie grime verses ("Ghrab Ilbain"), all bound by a palpable spirit of defiance. With proceeds going to Gaza's community kitchens, this moving collection of tracks transmits hope for Palestinian freedom. - Nyshka Chandran

### **Verraco** - Breathe, Godspeed (Timedance)
> On Breathe, Godspeed, Verraco is in full-throttle mode. The Colombian producer's subversive attitude takes flight via a bricolage of techno, dembow, IDM and glitch, bodying listeners with its sheer weight. Intensity levels escalate to a peak with a clever emphasis on rave fundamentals rather than shock value: there are nasty basslines, tribal influences, elements of rowdy post-dubstep and distorted vocal samples.Tracks are thunderous and jaw-dropping but strategically calibrated, transforming the cadence of Latin rhythms into a throbbing mass of futuristic sound design. Breathe, Godspeed is a radical snapshot of Verraco's music-making philosophy—it disorients, stimulates and, best of all, knows exactly what it wants to say. - Nyshka Chandran

### **Mabe Fratti** - Sentir Que No Sabes (Unheard of Hope)
> "At the moment, I'm pro-confusion. Or maybe not," wrote Guatemalan composer Mabe Fratti in the liner notes of her fourth LP, Sentir Que No Sabes, which means "to feel that I don't know" in Spanish. The first clue that demonstrates the strength of her latest work is opener, "Kravitz," with its funky cello bassline, dark atmospherics and strolling-pace rhythm. It's a fitting introduction to the musician's most accessible album yet, which largely forgoes the murky timbres and synth abstraction of her earlier works.Instead, tracks such as "Oídos," where Fratti's sweet soprano springs above whining trumpet, have spawned comparisons to the jazzy angst of singer-songwriters like Fiona Apple. Or take "Descubrimos un suspiro," where her voice is raw and up close as strings rustle against warm horns. On Sentir Que No Sabes, Fratti takes the threads of her denser projects and weaves it into a richly textured, utterly enthralling tapestry. - Kiana Mickles

### **Nídia & Valentina** - Estradas (Latency)
> Nídia and Valentina Magaletti may be from different musical backgrounds, but one thing they have in common is a shared disregard for convention. Nídia is something of an outlier within the Príncipe universe, her singular brand of kuduro and batida positioned slightly outside of the label's core sound. As for Magaletti, the experimental percussionist appears to be driven by a burning desire to constantly break new rhythmic ground, with each of her collaborative projects more ambitious than the last.It's no surprise, then, that their debut joint project, Estradas, sounded like little else this year. The nine-track LP begins as a tense to and fro between two artists feeling each other out, but the moments in which they find a shared musical language are dizzying. It's both a testament to the transcendental powers of rhythm and the thrilling possibilities of improvised collaboration. - Michael Lawson

### **Syclops** - Black Eye (Bubble Tease Comms)
> "Fried Ice Cream Is a Reality." Maurice Fulton's Twitter bio offers a glimpse into a typically press-shy artist's delight for oddball concepts. The Baltimore DJ and producer's vast discography connects the dots between disco, jazz, house and experimental electronics, from BOOF and Eddie & The Eggs to unexpected collaborations with Crystal Waters and Roísin Murphy.His singular sense for fusing the weird and the funky has perhaps never been more apparent than on Syclops' fourth album, Black Eye. The trio—Fulton, percussionist Mim Suleiman and guitarist Hanna Sarkari—delivers yet another kaleidoscopic album bursting at the seams with ideas: tracks like "Pink Sarah NYC Is Back" invoke future jazz and bleep techno, while "Karo Is Going Swimming" sounds like dub techno chucked through a cosmic blender. It's frankly bananas, and our dance floors are all the better for it. - Bella Aquilina

### **gyrofield** - These Heavens (XL Recordings)
> When getting arms around this riot of hyper-technical programming, overlapping rivulets of sound and intricate fidelity, it's worth stating things plainly: These Heavens is one of the most satisfying EPs in quite some time.Drum & bass virtuoso gyrofield (AKA Kiana Li) has been quietly prolific in recent years, popping up everywhere from Critical to Eastern Margins. Yet it was her XL debut where she truly shot for the moon with a record informed by stargazing and Stephen Hawking as much as Hideo Kojima and Noisia. Li practically undergoes a full villain arc in 23 minutes, staging a shift from tones so crystalline you'd be forgiven for thinking they were beamed direct from the Pillars of Creation, to mottled drumfunk hissing and heaving under the weight of menace. These Heavens is explosive, but more than that, it's pure cosmology in motion. - Gabriel Szatan

### **DJ Anderson do Paraíso** - Queridão (Nyege Nyege Tapes)
> DJ Anderson do Paraíso knows how to twist baile funk's frenetic energy into haunted minimalism. The Belo Horizonte native's productions merge sparse electronic elements inspired by drill and trap with sluggish violins, pianos, flutes and timpani—all of which fill the air with a mysterious sensuality and ominous aura. Queridão, which translates to "beloved" from Portuguese, is a collection of tracks that has taken the producer from SoundCloud cult favourite to living legend in the rising funk mineiro scene of Belo Horizonte.The mountainous, landlocked city is widely celebrated for its slower and more melodic take on funk, but what sets Anderson apart is his commitment to downright eerie experimentalism, stripping down the sound's full-bodied elements to forge epic and radical restraint. It's really no wonder that Queridão stands out as some of the most enticingly abstract dance music of the year. - GG Albuquerque

### **Polygonia** - Da Nao Tian Gong (Midgar)
> Da Nao Tian Gong is Polygonia's most watched childhood film. Translating to "Havoc in Heaven," the narrative links heaven to nature—from the peaches of immortality in the Heavenly Garden to Fruit Mountain. The Chinese-German artist has consistently sought out lessons from our environment, recently telling Resident Advisor: "People should collaborate together in peace to save our planet."In 2024, Earth is increasingly heating up. Cities—and people—have been set alight. On Da Nao Tian Gong, Polygonia makes sense of this destruction through an effervescent mix of ambient, techno and downtempo, using the synthetic to recreate the organic, from a synth pad dawn chorus to the rhythmic hissing of water. Nestled at the heart of this sublime EP lies the simple yet powerful message of protecting our world. The peaches, the seeds, the roots. In a year of mass displacement, what could be more pertinent than that? - Vivian Yeung

### **Astrid Sonne** - Great Doubt (Escho)
> Great Doubt is Astrid Sonne's first album as a singer-songwriter, but she's been using her voice for much longer. The Danish artist has spoken about her time spent in church choirs, acknowledging its role in shaping her vocals: "I definitely wouldn't be singing as loud as I do." On Great Doubt, Sonne is definitely loud, producing immense emotional volume out of sparse arrangements."Do you wanna" arrives with a straight but heavy drum beat as Sonne confesses, "Do you wanna have a baby? / I really don't know." This unnervingly direct existentialism runs through the entire album, whether in the slow, booming 808s on "Everything is unreal" or the simple pizzicato viola on "Almost." Sonne doesn't shy away from bold, unembellished statements, only augmenting the sense of intimacy (as on the plaintive, Ben Vince-assisted "Say you love me"). In daring to confront her deepest fears head-on, Sonne has made the year's most striking pop album. - Bella Aquilina

### **Charli xcx** - BRAT (Atlantic)
> For a decade, Charli xcx thrashed between two seemingly contradictory stations: pop sweetheart and cult icon. She lacquered finely tuned singles in industry-standard polish, then loaded brilliant, labyrinthine albums with dense lines about her deepest fears. With BRAT, she swung to please her niche—and ended up painting the summer radioactive green. Her most momentous album to date is a rare animal: a galvanising pop record all wound up for the club on one hand, a glistening smorgasbord of spilled guts on the other.By turning her insecurities inside out on songs like "Sympathy is a knife" and "Girl, so confusing," then counterweighting those cerebations with the whole-body release of "Von dutch" and "Club classics," Charli alchemised a new vision of her own success. She's long picked over the question of what it means to make it. BRAT homes in on something of an answer: there's no "it" to make. Sell all the records you want, or don't—you have to come home to yourself either way. Might as well crank the bass and dance through it. - Sasha Geffen

### **De Schuurman** - Bubbling Forever (Nyege Nyege Tapes)
> Slamming body music from a true master who transmits the vivacity and nerve of Caribbean club culture: that's Bubbling Forever. On his second official collection of bubbling—a sped-up mutation of dancehall—Dutch-Surinamese producer De Schuurman builds on the genre's Afro-diasporic legacy with a clutch of tracks designed to whip up hysteria in the rave."Benniale Dakar" starts with the ominous drama of an early Pop Smoke trap tune then launches into a rattling speed dembow. As smoky pads permeate the air, the beat decelerates into half-time—only a quick moment to gather your waist before the wine-inducing rhythms of "Bubbling Meets Kaseko," which fuse bubbling's restless kicks with traditional Surinamese skratji percussion. On "Stylez two," mischievous samples of Lil Jon's infamous "OK!" and KRS-One's "Sound of da Police" can jolt even the stiffest hips into work. When "Scratchin"'s pointillist synths plink around vocal samples of "I'm just scratchin' the surface," you get the sense it's both a call to action and warning shot: Schuurman is here to stay. - Rachel Grace Almeida

### **Loidis** - One Day (Incienso)
> Not waving, or drowning, but drifting. That's how 2024 felt for many of us: a serotonin crash made all the more raw by an increasingly cruel world. After years of clubland electrifying the masses with the shock of the new, we chose to lean the other way, prioritising cosy records that made you thankful for what you already have (a craving that, in alternative circles, drew people to the spectral-jukebox transmissions of Cindy Lee like moth to flame). Into this climate landed a masterclass in softer vibrations from Brian Leeds, who, as Huerco S. and Pendant, has already proved himself a master of suspended animation several times over. One Day both encapsulated the mood and cut through it like a beacon.Does it augur poorly for a culture built on progression to take a step back and recalibrate? Well, the past was priced in; Loidis is the ancient name for Leeds, after all. And though One Day was built around slippery micro rhythms and delayed dub stabs, Leeds hardly soapboxed for a return to subtlety. The strongest promo was essentially happenstance, after he termed the project "dub mnml emo tech" to wriggle out of anything too formal, but wound up perfectly articulating its playful vibe.Just as For Those Of You…'s truncated loops were a creative sleight-of-hand, One Day pulls off a sly trick throughout. Leeds mimics the lossy compression and audio degradation favoured by the clicks 'n cuts set, only this time using stem separation software and creative resampling that falls closer, he told us, to hypermodern genres. In doing so, he created a shapeshifting palette: all muzzled kicks, panned basslines bobbing through hyaline textures and indulgent codas tacked onto nine- or ten-minute tunes ("Why Do," "Love's Linneaments," "Sugar Snot") that you could have sworn flashed by in four. It scans as wrong at first blush, so you're compelled to run it back a dozen times—by which point, naturally, it sounds exceptional.One Day doesn't just revitalise styles that faded from favour; it glows with the patience of Shinchi Atobe and DJ Sprinkles, the frolic of Isolée and Dinky, the 3 AM soul-searching of Claro Intelecto and Paul St. Hilaire. Most obviously, the spirit of Alcachofa and Vocalcity feel hardcoded into its DNA. These are records that have meant a lot to people over the years, made by artists who have stood the test of time. I'd be lying if I didn't think Leeds is in that conversation now.When it arrived, One Day might have seemed too discrete to break out, but months of compulsive listening have upended that. If we're resting at a waystation en route to a destination as-yet-unclear, there was no more generous or agreeable companion. So while there aren't many conclusions to be drawn from the discomforting haze of 2024, this much is true: the album that felt primed to take a slow stroll to classic status has raced way ahead of schedule. It's already there. - Gabriel Szatan

## [The Best Albums of 2023](https://ra.co/features/4293)
Date: 2023-12-14T14:00:39.000Z

### Kelela - Raven (Warp Records)
> At the shows for her new album, Kelela stood alone onstage. This was a deliberate choice, she explained, to have everything stripped back so audiences could see her—and hear her—for all she was. But up there, the blue lights around her dimmed, it was clear that her solitary figure also reflected her more bitter-than-sweet struggles against what she described as "male stoicism." This remark came from the revelations she had while reading The Will to Change, an investigation of men, masculinity and love by the radical Black feminist scholar bell hooks. Her epiphany was painstakingly reflected in the dancehall derivation "On The Run": "You get around enough / Too busy actin' tough / Give me a softer side / I won't wait all night." Patriarchal culture doesn't only hurt women, Kelela discovered—it also restricts the way men are able to explore intimacy and achieve wholeness for themselves. I saw Kelela perform in Berlin. 13 of Raven's 15 tracks were produced there, and it shows. There's a sorrow and solemnity woven into the city's monochromatic corners that echo through Raven, like a pebble rattling in an empty aluminium can. Even the title track is underpinned by a spacious yearning, as if on the brink of a breaking point—"Took all my labour / Don't tell me that I'm strong," she sings, before gradually trotting into a heaving 4/4 beat, a subtle nod to clubbing as escapism. By the album's conclusion, "Far Away," Kelela finds her deliverance in the form of honeyed ad-libs undulating over sounds of crashing waves, as if signalling that with enough time and perspective, all pain can be alchemised into pure spirit. -Whitney Wei

### Caroline Polachek - Desire I Want To Turn Into You (Perpetual Novice)
> Diving headfirst into the delusion and madness that accompanies the all-consuming feeling of romantic and sexual passion, this unapologetically raw album leaves no stone unturned in its portrayal of emotional intensity. Through visceral lyrics that underline the idea of desire as a truly physical sensation, the ex-Chairlift vocalist sings of self-indulgent surrender to a lover without the slightest care of appearing desperate or needy. But it's the production—from Polachek and Danny L. Harle—that truly makes this a multifaceted pop record: feathery drum & bass, flamenco, dreamy rock and bassy R&B bops add to the physicality of Polachek's feelings, pushing her theatrical vocals outside of the shielded realm of inner thoughts and into the material world. -Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### James Holden - Imagine This Is A High Dimensional Space Of All Possibilities (Border Community)
> James Holden's music has always been otherworldly. Raised on pirate radio, folktronica, free jazz and everything in between, he conjures up mythical fairy tales where flickers of dance music past meander into pastoral soundscapes. This all culminated with Imagine This Is A High Dimensional Space Of All Possibilities, which marks a welcome return to the club for Holden—or his version of it, anyway. Recognisable dance music tropes (hints of dub techno, echoes of house, microdoses of rave) nestle into the rich and complex instrumentation that gives all of Holden's music its distinctive flair. If Jon Hassell had been born four decades later and became hooked on acid house, this is the album he would've wanted to write. -Henry Ivry Listen: Bandcamp

### Tirzah - trip9love...? (Domino)
> Over the past decade, childhood friends Tirzah Maston and Mica Levi have become a quietly formidable power duo (in leftfield music circles, at least). On their latest LP of heart-tugging R&B, Levi's tough 808s and trilling piano sketches hold a steady, unrelenting pace while Tirzah pours her heart into 11 rough-and-ready love songs. All the familiar hallmarks of Tirzah are there—understated vocals and a sound rooted in "disarming simplicity"—but here everything is notched up to a new, more physical intensity. Each track packs a smouldering punch and Levi's distorted piano melodies on tracks like "F22" and "Promises" have Grand Cru earworm qualities. The album turns Tirzah and Levi's often ramshackle songs into a steamrolling train that tugs at the heartstrings all the harder, while still holding onto the lightweight feel that makes all of the project's music so enchanting. -Conor McTernan Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Regal86 - La Onda (Self-released)
> If there was one trend in techno to note this year—aside from "fast"—it was hardgroove, a taut and loopy style originally pioneered in the '90s and making one hell of a comeback on dance floors across the Americas and Europe in 2023. Regal86, a buzzy producer from Monterrey makes all kinds of music, but he's particularly good at hardgroove. His album La Onda landed at the perfect time to take the revival to the next level. With breathless sequencing and expert programming, this is hard, fast dance music that doesn't bludgeon you over the head, but instead invites you to dance and get lost in its intricacies. And with trip-hop breaks and clever interludes, La Onda works as an album through and through, recalling some '90s techno greats with real finesse. -Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Overmono - Good Lies (XL Recordings)
> Going from throwing makeshift parties deep in the woods to sold-out global tours, Overmono's ascent is long overdue. After a decade of passionate grinding in the underground, their debut album, Good Lies, makes a well-earned victory lap. Boundless euphoria is the goal and '90s rave and Burial-adjacent techno are the means—including radio-ready vocal chops from the likes of Tirzah, Slowthai and CASISDEAD. Having penned a vibrant love letter to both the past and present of UK dance music, the two brothers from rural Wales establish themselves as authors of its future. -Emeka Okonkwo Listen: Bandcamp

### James Blake - Playing Robots Into Heaven (Columbia)
> Don't call it a comeback… but James Blake's latest album kind of feels like a comeback. He's spent years perfecting an electronic singer-songwriter style that has seen him working with everyone from Kendrick Lamar to Frank Ocean. On Playing Robots Into Heaven, he dives head first into club music and delivers some of his canniest fusions yet. The melodrama and introspection is still there, but on tracks like the thrilling "Loading" or the surging house of "Fall Back," his words—and dextrous vocal chopping—gains a whole new power, especially when sandwiched between woozy ballads like "Fire The Editor." In other words, it's the best of both worlds. -Andrew Ryce Apple Music / Spotify

### Mr. G - Pearls Don't Lay On The Shore (Childhood)
> According to Mr. G, Pearls Don't Lay On The Shore is what happens when he makes music from the soul. Over 14 tracks, the funky tech house he built his name on makes room for plaintive New Age delights and darkly tinted downtempo. It's a turbulent, subaquatic voyage that reaches even murkier depths than 2021's The Forced Force Is Not The True Force. Where the sonar-guided ominousness and broad sawtooth basslines on tracks like "No Safe Zones" evoke the ocean floor, the searching keys and trance-inducing hand drums on tracks like "For Those Who Have Lost" still reach for the cosmos. A riveting ode to his mother Sylvia, Pearls Don't Lay On The Shore is Mr G. at his most soul searching and experimental. -Emeka Okonkwo Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### DJ Gigola - Fluid Meditations (Live From Earth)
> Aside from being a phenomenal debut album, Fluid Meditations is compelling because it embodies the enduring influence of wellness culture on dance music. The album is a tropical, at times ghostly take on modern New Age electronic music, with vocal techniques that recall Voice Actor's sibilant whispers and the guided meditation of DJ Python's memorable 2020 cut "ADMSDP." The album picks up in its second half, the meditation laid underneath hoover synths and spritely trance, making it a record that travels well from day into night. -Kiana Mickles Listen: Bandcamp

### Maara - The Ancient Truth (Step Ball Chain)
> Maara has a preternatural sense for interstellar atmospheres that are also suited to intimate home listening. Her debut album yawns to life with loose breakbeats over a lattice of whispery vocals, and eventually spins out into another realm of glimmering downtempo music. A special kind of self-assured ease in drifting into the unknown exists here. The Ancient Truth feels like a period of focused introspection, full of lush pads and pensive basslines, that reveals an inner world even more vast and mystical than how it first seems (just after the beat drops on the title track, a "wake up, wake up" chirps in the distance). All it takes is a wide-eyed sense of wonder to appreciate Dunbar's gentle yet far-flung exploration. -Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp

### Surgeon - Crash Recoil (Tresor)
> On Crash Recoil, Surgeon's first album in five years, he said he tried to bring his live improvisational sets to the studio for the first time, "in the same way that bands tour songs before going into the studio to record an album." The Detroit-indebted swing of earlier albums is subdued to a simmering pulse, and Surgeon's longtime influences—experimental rock bands Coil and Faust—take centre stage. Spectral pads elongate over crunchy drums. Abrasive melodies appear and fade into the ether. Songs travel with the meandering, liberated structure of music built through feeling instead of dance floor mania, unlocking a new level of depth and nuance in one of the most legendary catalogues in techno. -Kiana Mickles Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Wata Igarashi - Agartha (Kompakt)
> Techno trends come and go, but Wata Igarashi will never go out of style. Cerebral, psychedelic, Rome school—whatever adjective you choose to describe the Japanese producer's music, so long as clubs are willing to stay open for more than 12 hours at a time, there'll always be DJs digging for Igarashi's style of lean, introverted techno. This makes his debut album, Agartha, such a curveball. The LP fuses Berlin school Krautrock and fourth world ambient with the odd bit of Detroit electro and techno, both unexpected and unbelievably impressive. Igarashi has always been more than "just" a techno producer, but Agartha solidifies his reputation as a true electronic music visionary. -Henry Ivry Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Yves Tumor - Praise a Lord Who Chews But Does Not Consume (Warp Records)
> It's hard to believe Yves Tumor's Praise A Lord Who Chews But Which Does Not Consume; (Or Simply, Hot Between Worlds) came out in March—it already feels like one of those timeless cult albums fans know inside-out. In recent years, the US artist has swirled around the smokey, delay-drenched periphery of '90s alt rock. Here, they jump right in, heels first, to riff on alt-rock greats like Jimi Hendrix ("Heaven Surround Us…"), The Strokes ("Operator") and even prime-era Bloc Party ("In Spite of War"), with epic guitar leads and explosive drum patterns as the rushing, technicolour backdrop to Tumor's angsty lyricism. -Sophie McNulty Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Nondi_ - Flood City Trax (Planet Mu)
> Johnstown, Pennsylvania, suffered devastating floods in 1889, 1936 and 1977. What was once a city with a thriving steel mill and coal industry was left in tatters alongside a draining population. According to local producer Nondi_, those who were left behind—like herself—now live in limbo, floating between boredom and a constant fear of when the next flood will strike. On her ambient juke LP Flood City Trax, cutesy, cotton-cloud FX meet frenetic footwork percussion to convey a conflicting and distant depiction of a place that's been left for dead by the rest of the world, yet stubbornly lives on. -Joseph Francis Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Paul St. Hilaire - Tikiman Vol.1 (Kynant Records)
> It's been 17 years since his last album, but Paul St. Hilaire remains dub techno incarnate. The OG producer and Basic Channel collaborator resurfaced this March with nine exquisite tracks that show off his mastery of subtle, politically charged grooves. Touching on downtempo, minimal techno, roots reggae and dancehall, Tikiman Vol.1 runs the gamut genre-wise while delivering concise commentary on displacement, education and memory. Fuzzy dub tones on "Keep Safe" and "The Weather Man" give way to chuggier cuts like "In Door," with St. Hilaire's mesmeric vocals and streamlined basslines acting as key transition tools throughout. Still instantly recognisable, the dub techno MC has a way of making dreamy, '90s-style atmospheres feel fresh with carefully leftfield touches. -Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp

### Laurel Halo - Atlas (Awe)
> Laurel Halo never loved playing the piano, but she returned to it just before the pandemic. And then she was kind of stuck with it, until it became her defining instrument of the decade so far. On Atlas, her first so-called ambient album, she takes her piano and the sounds of collaborators on strings and explodes it into sonic dust. Those particles are rearranged into gentle compositions that inhale and exhale like a living respiratory system, with melodies that appear like clouds on the horizon before rolling away and letting the music clear up again. Atlas takes the fearless compositional framework of past albums and her ear for slight-but-dazzling melodies and presents them in a new, almost neoclassical way. It's another excellent entry in one of dance music's most wonderfully unpredictable discographies. -Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### DJ Danifox - Ansiedade (Príncipe)
> Traditionally, batida is a sound characterised by a lively interplay of emotions and energies: roiling drums, racing tempos and rousing vocals. Lisbon label Príncipe has long documented the genre's many faces, from electro bangers to housey grooves, and this stunning offering from one of its core members reveals a foggier take. The slow-burning LP unravels like a gentle love letter, pairing intuitive, staccato drums with conversational vocals and lush instrumentation (guitar and woodwinds). There are hints of jazz, trap and dub techno—perhaps a reference to batida's own cross-pollination from various Angolan and Portuguese styles—and a thread of tenderness and toughness. Danifox's lilting melodies wrap batida's bounce into a dulcet, romantic daze. -Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### a.s.o. - a.s.o. (Low Lying Records)
> Lewie Day and Alia Seror-O'Neill's debut self-titled LP as a.s.o is one of those albums that anyone with a longing for nostalgia could fall in love with—fans of Mazzy Star, Warp Records devotees, trip-hop lovers. Part of the reason why is because the album's palette sounds eerily familiar, like every phenomenal downtempo album released before the turn of the millennium blended into one. But it's not pastiche: the lyrics feel bitingly modern and the production is taken to outer space in ways their predecessors didn't yet have the language for. And to top it off, Seror-O'Neill's frigid, sultry voice reverberates through it all gracefully. -Kiana Mickles Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Sofia Kourtesis - Madres (Ninja Tune)
> There's a track on Madres, the debut album from Berlin-based artist Sofia Kourtesis, named after the neurosurgeon who saved her mother's life. Kourtesis's music has always been connected to familial relationships—2021's Fresia Magalena EP was named after Fresia (her mother) and Magdalena (the district in Lima where she's from) while reflecting on the death of her father—but with each new record her music becomes an even more personal, ecstatic and richly layered collage. Madres deftly combines house music with field recordings from indigenous communities, the Peruvian cajón drum, clips from a protest against homophobia and pan-Latin American rhythms. Kourtesis makes restorative, kaleidoscopic house music that blooms from her heart and tugs at the strings of others, highlighting the power of dance floor healing. -Katie Thomas Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music

### Various - Chants Of The Holy Oyster (Kalahari Oyster Cult)
> Chants Of The Holy Oyster celebrates six years of Rey Colino's Kalahari Oyster Cult, documenting the Amsterdam label's increasingly singular footprint on contemporary club music. Connecting the dots between various corners of '90s dance music—from dreamy IDM to spacious electro, squelchy trance to wiggly tech house—Colino's vision updates these sounds, rather than basking in nostalgia. With contributions from best-in-school producers such as Roza Terenzi, Sansibar, Maara, Priori and more, the compilation serves as a great reminder that the fruits of the '90s are still ripe for renovation (and innovation). -Bella Aquilina Listen: Bandcamp

### Brutalismus 3000 - ULTRAKUNST (Live From Earth Klub)
> Over the last two years, Brutalismus 3000 have become one of the biggest techno acts in Europe through sheer force of will and attitude. Their music, which they call "anti-techno" or "nu-gabber-post-techno-punk"—and they won't say it, but it's also kind of bloghouse—is confrontational but also funny. They channel the outlandish vibe of early electroclash acts and dress it up in an outfit thrifted from Humana that you might see walking down Warschauer Strasse on a Friday night. Tales of murder, excess and scene-baiting ("Safe Space") are soundtracked by short-circuiting electronics, making for a gleeful LP as giddy as it is confrontational, leaving a path of destruction and laughter in its wake. -Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Mun Sing - Inflatable Gravestone (Planet Mu)
> Inflatable Gravestone, the title of Mun Sing's debut album on Planet Mu, neatly summarises the fantastical world the Giant Swan cofounder operates in: a cold, hard symbol of death is turned into something squashy and playful. The music on Inflatable Gravestone folds listeners into that strange and wonderful land, like jumping on a bouncy castle that deflates and re-inflates without warning. The textures are intense ("Squabble"), the rhythms jolting, swerving and sometimes falling off into oblivion ("Gliding"). And it all ties together with an underlying absurdity ("Spider"). It's a place only a truly brilliant and off-kilter mind could conjure up. -Sophie McNulty Listen: Bandcamp

### Natural Wonder Beauty Concept - Natural Wonder Beauty Concept (Mexican Summer)
> On their self-titled debut album, Ana Roxanne and DJ Python aim to massage out the beauty in loneliness and alienation. Floating on tides of ambient synths, the duo employ emo rap, synth pop, lucid breakbeat and more to explore the substrates of deep connection and unspoken tenderness. Avant-garde instrumental flourishes seamlessly blend into metropolis-at-night atmospherics. Roxanne's ethereal singing plucks at every fibre of your being, while Python's intricate percussion arrangements are modulated until they begin to trickle like water. These two masters of contemplative, shoegazey electronica come together for a debut that lives up to its name and more. -Emeka Okonkwo Listen: Bandcamp

### Ciel - Homesick (Parallel Minds)
> The miracle of globalised contemporary electronic music is how artists have imprinted their own unique cultural identity into their productions. The stylistically and geographically roving debut album from Ciel is one such example, melding downtempo, ambient and electro. Ciel, who was born in Xi'an, China, and came of age in Toronto, based Homesick on eight types of traditional Chinese instruments, each of which correspond to the individual track titles. The most striking among them is the anxious tremble of "Metal," interpolated between syncopated drums, and "Silk," all sly chimes and rotund basslines. Conceptually rich, Homesick embroiders the disparate textures of Ciel's Eastern home and her Western world into one elegant tapestry. -Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Pangaea - Changing Channels (Hessle Audio)
> Festival FOMO moment of 2023? It's gotta be Ben UFO unleashing Pangaea's "Bad Lines" at Dekmantel. The happy hardcore-inspired anthem was the coda to the UK artist's short but magnificently sweet album, Changing Channels, which nailed the hard-to-wrangle cocktail of silly yet classy. In one fell swoop, Pangaea wrote the tune of the summer, doffed his cap to the hardcore continuum and poked fun at dance music's current obsession with speed and neon sounds—all with a massive smile on his face. -Carlos Hawthorn Listen: Bandcamp

### K-Lone - Swells (Wisdom Teeth)
> Swells dropped on July 7th, a few days before I made my annual pilgrimage to Love International festival. In Tisno, the sea sparkles, the air is hot and the buzz of the cicadas in the trees is omnipresent. I listened to the glossy ripples of K-Lone's second album as I lay by the water, felt the sun on my skin and closed my eyes to allow my body to recover from the night before—the setting was just right. There are a couple dance floor-leaning tracks on the LP ("Love Me A Little," "Gel"), but Swells is largely made up of elastic tunes that slip, slide and undulate like the lapping of waves on a shoreline. Eliza Rose's vocal appears in hazy manipulations throughout (most notably on woozy R&B cut "With U"), accompanying colourful tones, melodies that glimmer and chords that melt into each other. -Katie Thomas Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Deena Abdelwahed - Jbal Rrsas (Infine Music)
> Tunisian artist Deena Abdelwahed has a predilection for pulling sonic touchpoints from the MENA region and dissolving them into dense, at times confrontational, productions. Case in point is opener "The Key To The Exit," her interpretation of the EDM-adjacent working class Egyptian genre mahraganat. It's a stunner of jagged synth lines that, in spite of its influences, feels like an electronic cousin to doom metal riffs. "Six As Oil" is just as intrepid. Abdelwahed slings around a fugue of subterranean drones, sustained sirens and tight snares to make for a deliciously anti-authoritarian rallying cry. -Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Oceanic - Choral Feeling (Nous'klaer Audio)
> Why do we sing? It remains one of the great mysteries of human evolution. But to open your mouth, vibrate your vocal chords and produce musical tones through exalting air is at the core of being human. To do so in unison with others is a tradition that can be traced back time immemorial. On his debut album, Oceanic reimagines choral music for the 21st century, chopping, warping and distorting the voices of 30 friends to create Choral Feeling. Equal parts odd and profound, the vocals are often distorted beyond recognition, whether drawn out into haunting melodies or woven into drum patterns through syncopated rhythms. Oberman stays true to choral music's antiquated roots, producing a capacious vision of human connection, one that is mysterious, kaleidoscopic and fundamentally beautiful. -Bella Aquilina Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Fever Ray - Radical Romantics (Rabid Records)
> Fever Ray's third album is probably the closest that Karin Dreijer's solo project has come to sounding like The Knife, and that's no bad thing. Across ten outré pop tracks that range from the political to the almost hilariously personal (like when they threaten their child's bully on "Even It Out"), Dreijer belts out some of their catchiest hooks over neon-hued production from Trent Reznor, Nídia, Peder Mannerfelt and more. Where Dreijer's past work has revelled in alien unintelligibility, Radical Romantics puts its journey of self-discovery, emotion and passion out there for everyone to see, in all its pseudo-tropical, plastic-palm-tree and artificial beach glory. -Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Purelink - Signs (Peak Oil)
> Signs, the stunning debut album from Chicago trio Purelink, occupies a nook all of its own in the broad realm of chill-out music—too feathery to be IDM, yet too alert to be ambient. This dubby netherworld, all gentle donks and silky earworms, evokes masters like Jan Jelinek and Lowtec. There's tension and dialogue. In short, don't be fooled into thinking this is background music—you'll be sitting bolt upright within minutes, marvelling at the wisps, wafts and occasional distant chime. It's all too beautiful to ignore. -Carlos Hawthorn Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

Date: 2022-12-21T13:00:47.000Z

### Fact Mix 878 (Juba)
> Zipline through a pastiche of Afro-electronic sounds, both domestic and diasporic. Juba, a British-Nigerian DJ who was recently featured in our newest episode of Soundtracking, cherrypicks from gqom, global club, techno and amapiano (the scene's consistent genre du jour) with an energetic panache more often reserved for dancers in front of the decks. The hour-and-a-half, which "ends on a rhythmic high," in the artist’s own words, boasts cameo tracks from the veritable who's-who of the Black underground: DJ Lag, Anz, DJ Swisha, Griffit Vigo and Juba's close friend and promising talent Gafacci. At a most unexpected apotheosis, she tucks in a tasteful Avicii bootleg by Dee Traits as well as the Pearson Sound remix of Nick León's "Xtasis (feat. Dj Babatr)", AKA RA's track of the year. Both inclusions mirror two ubiquitous trends of 2022: the Latin-infused techno and pop edit predilections of the underground—signifying the savviness of a selector in the know. All in all, the mix delivers an uppercut of infectious optimism in a new chapter defined by post-pandemic growing pains. —Whitney Wei

### fabric presents (Leon Vynehall)
> Creative pressure is a very real thing for artists. How does one constantly evolve and meet—even surpass—their best work? Leon Vynehall seems to know the answer. Since 2018's powerful conceptual album Nothing Is Still, the UK musician has matured from a talented club producer into a storyteller par excellence, weaving original and compelling narratives through sound. 2019's RA-recommended DJ-Kicks was one of the best mixes that year. Now, in 2022, he's charted again. Like DJ-Kicks, fabric presents Leon Vynehall is all about dynamics, except this time the focus is on the club. You'd think that might be restrictive, but Vynehall is a master at finding common threads and energies in disparate musical worlds. Here, work by Mala, A2, Or:la, Ehua, Lady Blacktronika, Commodo, Hagan, Skee Mask and textures from so many other producers hang together in a smoky, soulful soup. The stitching is sublime, the music consistently excellent. At points, it's enough to take your breath away. —Carlos Hawthorn

### Live At Dimensions 2021 (Joe Delon)
> Hot take: Joe Delon likes dance music more than just about anyone. He tours all the time, but still finds time to write a regular newsletter about everything going on around him. As a DJ he exudes enthusiasm, playing groovy records that run the gamut from sleek contemporary tech house to old school Italo classics. This live recording from Dimensions captures his range perfectly: he starts low and slow, but just as things get a bit heady, he makes a U-turn with the outrageous vocal track "Adventure" by Eleanor and Shep Pettibone. From there, things dart between the cerebral and the cheesy. Vintage hip house gives way to G-funk-laced electro and acid before dissipating into celestial techno and old school rave. It's hard to imagine that even the security team wasn't losing it during this masterclass in Tisno. —Henry Ivy

### Accidental Meetings Podcast #72 (Yumi)
> New York DJ Yumi was probably a new name to a lot of people when they first heard this mix for UK platform Accidental Meetings, but anyone who did listen was probably left hungry for more. This 66-minute journey is the kind of unassuming but carefully built mix that lays eggs in your brain and hatches weeks later. Eventually, before you know it, you'll memorize every transition. Speaking of transitions, they're all remarkably seamless as Yumi blends together odd tracks at various tempos, gradually pulling off a 30 BPM change so impeccably that you barely notice it. Maybe RA staffer livwutang put it best in one of the SoundCloud comments: "dude [this] is fucking wild… im glad im alive to hear this sound." —Andrew Ryce

### HÖR, January 13 2022 (D Dan)
> Berlin-based DJ and Mala Junta resident D.Dan had a big year. Seemingly unknown during the recesses of the pandemic, he catapulted to international acclaim in the last 18 months, not only because of his unanticipated glut of speed-demon dance floor releases—all of which skirt the 150 BPM mark—but also because of his position at the helm of a refreshing new trend towards nimble, groovy techno. His HÖR Berlin mix from January this year perfectly encapsulates this style. Minimal yet replete with understated hooks, it layers psychedelic flurries of toms with tribal drums, house vocals and trancey melodic fills. Strategically moving from rhythmic tracks to deep peak-time riffs and back, he showcases here why he's become such a lauded underground tastemaker—and a name to watch. —Chloe Lula

### Juanita's 063 (Quest?onmarq)
> "Spiraling" is a concept central to quest?onmarq's work. The New York-based DJ hosts a Lot Radio show of the same name, which sees them exploring a vast range of genres, from breaks to gqom, experimental and the harder regions of techno. They are not only technically skilled, but they have also been gifted with an insatiable curiosity about music, which allows them to play pretty much anything. For the 420-themed mix series, Juanita's—a platform on which DJs typically showcase the slower, sweet-tempered end of their collections—quest?onmarq turned to hazy breaks. The windswept mix breezes past early works like Equinox's rattling "Taking Over" to contemporary jungle like "For The Headstrong" by Tim Reaper & Response. It's a tutorial in considered pacing, showcasing how to play fast while maintaining a subdued energy. —Kiana Mickles

### Untitled 909 117 (Toumba)
> Dubby, dark and loaded with gnarly bassweight, Toumba's Untitled 909 Podcast is a beastly mix that infuses halftime mutations with a sense of industrial-tinged dread. It's a perfect introduction to the Amman-based artist, whose style nods to Nervous Horizon, Hessle Audio (home to his latest EP) and Nyege Nyege Tapes. The up-and-coming producer shows off his love for tectonic basslines, footwork, hiphop, Middle East folk rhythms and hybrid club music from the developing world during this 80-minute session, which features South Korea's NET GALA gqom ensemble Phelimuncasi reworked into a glitchy bricolage, as well as Dua Saleh's delicate trap. Toumba plays for the dance floor, but he's not afraid to indulge in experimental atmospherics and distorted textures either. This sense of adventure makes this mix powerful—and a whole lot of fun. —Nyshka Chandran

### Honcho Podcast Series 108 (Kilopatrah Jones)
> On September 15th, Haitian-born, Queens-based DJ Kilopatrah Jones wrote on Instagram: "When you think of house music, what do you think of? For me, it's house dancing, getting free on the beat with a friend [you] made on the dance floor." The 108th edition of the Honcho Podcast Series, delivered by Jones as a special Pride mix, encapsulates this feeling—the joy of dancing, moving your body in sync with the kindred spirit on the dance floor you met just moments ago. Full of piano riffs, sensual vocals and a whole lot of groove, Kilopatrah Jones's Honcho offering is an hour of brilliant, ecstatic house that will make you dance until you sweat. —Katie Thomas

### BSU 066 (Truly Madly)
> It's possible that Michael Joyce, AKA Truly Madly, is jumping between two or three different tracks in the first six minutes of his Butter Side Up Mix. It's also entirely possible that Joyce owns a 12-inch that somehow overlays sweeping chords with gurning rave stabs, rolling hand drums and short-circuiting electrical currents. The fact that we'll likely never know the answer is part of the fun (plus, it's not like we'd be able to find any of the records he plays anyways). This two-hour treasure trove of all things '90s sees Joyce in particularly bouncy and jubilant form. There are Latin-flavored rhythms, vintage NY vocals, and little bits of proper late night garage. The mixing is seamless without being showy, and Joyce keeps us on the edge of our seats the whole time, wondering what Shazam-breaking gem he'll reach for next. —H.I.

### Live From Sugar Hill (Jon K)
> Striking twists and turns are what make Live From Sugar Hill such a sharp and dynamic mix worthy of the physical media it was released on. Taken from Jon Kraus's set for Club Night Club at Brooklyn’s Sugar Hill Disco in September 2021, the cassette (released this year) niftily winds through bouts of grime, baile funk, gqom, ballroom and Jersey club like an alpine skier through a mogul field. Moments of more atmospheric, experimental tunes tease respite here and there, but Kraus knows the attention span of a dance floor all too well. On Live From Sugar Hill, a volley of breaks or a wall of kick drums is always only just around the corner. —Joseph Francis

## [The Best Tracks of 2022](https://ra.co/features/4098)
Date: 2022-12-20T15:45:42.000Z

### Nick León feat. DJ Babatr - Xtasis (TraTraTrax)
> If 2022 belongs to anyone, it's Nick León. The Miami producer is at the forefront of a new wave of 305-area artists who fuse together the city's unique tapestry of Hispanic cultures—and its deep connections to Latin America—with its robust dance music history. León specifically mixes influences from reggaeton and perreo into what is sometimes termed "Latin tribal techno," but whatever you want to call it, there's no denying the appeal of "Xtasis," the track most of us heard out on dance floors more than any other, by a country mile. "Xtasis," a collaboration with Venezuelan raptor house pioneer DJ Babatr, is a good example of the intercontinental cross-pollination happening within this scene. The percussion plays a trick, both four-on-the-floor and broken at the same time, at a chemically-enhanced pace with distant vocal wails that add a lysergic flair. But "Xtasis"—and its accompanying Pearson Sound and Doctor Jeep remixes—really clicks with the old-school organ bassline that drops in at about the two-minute mark. It's something so simple, so familiar and, frankly, genius, that by the time the kick drum drops back in, the room should be in a frenzy. If it isn't, then you're probably in the wrong place. —Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Kelela - Washed Away (Warp Records)
> It's a special, and rare, moment when music drops and completely disrupts the flow of the internet. This was the case with Kelela's "Washed Away," her first single since she put out her acclaimed debut album Take Me Apart five years ago. During the hiatus, she looked inward and studied literature on misogynoir, Black labour and racial capitalism. Suffused in hazy pads and reverbed vocals that sound more like mantras than vocal refrains, "Washed Away" could be perceived as the release of all this collective pain. In a recent interview with Dazed, Kelela described the single as a "heart check-in," a song recorded to "send out a clear message to Black people, who are my core audience and who I intend this music for, that you n***as are worthy." Message received. — Kiana Mickles Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Rhyw - Honey Badger (Voam)
> On paper, "Honey Badger" shouldn't work. Its main drum line moves in and out of time with the impatience of a toddler hammering at a sequencer. The sole synth—the closest the track has to a melody—is aggressively abrasive, as if it were made from a substance somewhere between quicksand and sandpaper. But I'll be damned if it isn't one of the catchiest tracks I've heard all year. Undeniably weird, but equally infectious, if you heard the track out (and odds are you did if you went to a festival this summer), it sent every crowd into full blown meltdown. Walking away from any set where it was deployed meant that there were punters with their heads still spinning trying to shriek along to those metallic snares. —Henry Ivry Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### A+A - Eternal September (AD 93)
> Both times I heard "Eternal September" this summer I didn't know what it was. On each occasion, it was sunrise at a festival, those blissful hours when time seems to stand still as the sky changes from milky to glowing. It's an ideal track for those hazy moments, with swathes of lush organ chords and fluttering high notes that swoop around like birds with silk wings. When Avalon Emerson and Anunaku (AKA TSVI) shared the upcoming release online, Midland commented on the former's Instagram saying: "I have played these songs and had a nice time while doing so!" To which I thought: I have danced to these songs and had a nice time while doing so! —Katie Thomas Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### DJ Plead - Come Quick (Livity Sound)
> DJ Plead usually plays and produces slick, percussive zingers that meld traditional rhythms from the Middle East with high-tempo dance music. But on his second offering for Livity Sound, the Nervous Horizon core member switches out his frenzied pace for a more pared-down tone. Drums remain his core ingredient but the mood is more whimsical, making the record feel more like a score to a picnic in the park rather than a party. Despite its light-hearted nature, "Come Quick" is still loaded with sharp corners and jolting melodies—a true day to dusk record. —Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Ahadadream - Spaceship (More Time)
> Imagine Lunice, DJ Lag, Roska and Benga linking up for a recording session, and you start to get a sense of what "Spaceship" sounds like. On an EP filled with massive, celebratory tracks, Ahadadream's "Spaceship" was colossal. Every few bars it felt like he was shifting his reference points. What starts as a UK-funky-meets-gqom hybrid morphs into a dubstep throwback with its airy, descending melody. But then the xylophone chimes and upbeat snares capture the maximalism of TNGHT records. As the inadequacy of comparison should make clear, though, "Spaceship" is sui generis, announcing the arrival of a new torchbearer for all things big and bassy. —H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Pariah - Caterpillar (Voam)
> It's been a few years since Pariah put out any solo material (he's primarily active as one half of Karenn alongside Blawan). It's been even longer since he released dance music in his own right. Caterpillar, then—which came out in June on Voam, the label he runs with Blawan—is an exciting interruption to this interlude. The hypnotic title track is capital-T techno, but it's heavily textured and nuanced, layering dense modular noodlings with a repeating guttural squelch that sounds more like an off-the-cuff live rip than the polished veneer of most of today's peak-time output. Flanged-out percussion, sizzling analog stabs and a spacey, Pole Group-like synth lead make it the ultimate selection for breaking open a late night set. —Chloe Lula Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### DJ Python - Angel (Incienso)
> At first listen, it's almost unbelievable that Brian Piñyero, better known by his pseudonyms DJ Python and Luis, creates his ambient reggaeton in Ridgewood, Queens. "Angel," off of his EP Club Sentimientos, Vol. 2, has a lot of heart and an even gooier center in its sonic embrace of supple electronics. The ten minute-plus track feels like a weekend-long sojourn into a daydream far from the Halsey L stop, as lush—almost levitating—synth pads breathe deeply around pattering tablas and soufflé riddims. Within its sumptuous depths, there's an earnest, refreshingly unironic appeal to softening, unfolding and tenderness. —Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Sally C - Downtown (Big Saldo's Chunkers)
> When Sally C released the second EP on her label Big Saldo's Chunkers back in April, the tracks had already been doing the rounds for almost a year. Most notable was "Downtown," a big, brash, in-your-face hip house roller that encapsulates what Sally C and her pals mean when they refer to a "chunker." This is functional, no-nonsense dance music that does exactly what it needs to: make your body want to move and groove. The vocal samples are textbook—"Put the needle on the record" and "Do you want to dance?"—but they're a consummate companion for a tune designed to keep the party pumping, proof that less isn't always more. —K.T. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Nikki Nair - Step 2 (n goes to infinity)
> It's hard to imagine following dance music in 2022 and not hearing at least a handful of Nikki Nair tracks. The genre-hopping polyglot was everywhere with everyone, establishing a tight but all-over-the-place sound that blends electro, drum & bass, jungle and footwork. Case in point, "Step 2," which kicked off Nair's own label n goes to infinity. It starts out as hectic uptempo acid jungle track, before crescendoing into a halftime breakdown full of metallic skronks and other aural detritus. It's like walking from a FABRICLIVE night into a Daedalus set circa 2011, and then finishes off with a sprightly techno-jungle jig that feels completely of the moment—an era that Nair is helping define with each new release. —A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### GiGi FM - Manas (PST) (Bambe)
> GiGi FM's first signed EP, Magnetite, supposedly holds "spiritually-charged techno mantras." While that may conjure a suite of vaguely spiritual motifs, we get none of that on this kinetic four-tracker. "Manas (PST)" embodies her aesthetic most distinctly, nodding subtly to the artist's sometimes collaborator, Donato Dozzy, with its deeply tribal percussive intro. The rest of the song is beguilingly simple; the propulsive kick-and-tom pattern continues uninterrupted under a single-note cowbell, never changing except for a brief drop about two-thirds in. GiGi FM, an alumnus of both the New York City Ballet and the Alvin Ailey Theatre, has said that the release is a testament to the ritualistic relationship between movement and music. This synergistic dynamic is elegantly elicited on the EP's A2, which is trance-inducingly danceable. —C.L. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Heavee - Sonic Warfare (Hyperdub)
> Heavee's Audio Assault was probably our favourite record on Hyperdub this year, with six tracks of inventive hybrid footwork that capture the label's ethos to a T. The best example was probably "Sonic Warfare"—which shares its name with Kode9's book—a blend of jabby footwork drums, eerie synths and a melodic motif that stutters and fades like electrical interference. —A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Physical Therapy - Emotional Rescue (Allergy Season)
> Physical Therapy spent the last four years working diligently behind the scenes on his label, Allergy Season, as well as releasing records via a slew of his other aliases (Car Culture, DJ Overnite and Fatherhood, his project with Michael Magnan, to name a few). His last release under his original moniker, the 2015 EP Million Years Crushed, was deep, busy and granular. His latest album, Teardrops On My Garage, sounds like a subdued version of Physical Therapy. The garage-inspired chopped vocals are pitched-up and sweet, the melodies resonant and rich. My personal favourite, "Emotional Rescue," is an edit of Tru Faith's "Let The Beat Hit 'Em," that brightens the source material's original vocals with a sparkling melody and rollicking breaks. —K.M.

### Isabella Lovestory - Exibisionista (Self-released)
> Reggaeton has been undergoing a renaissance in the electronic music world in recent years as artists like Rosa Pistola and the trio Sangra Nueva dissect dembow loops with a toolbox of global club rhythms, producing a kaleidoscope of sub-genres. Among those fringe styles is perreopop, and Isabella Lovestory is one of its leading faces. Here, her sultry lyrics and cam girl aesthetic take on an almost spooky air thanks to producers Nick León and Kamixlo who inject elements of dub and industrial into classic dancehall patterns. Transforming what would have been a regular pop song into a deadly dance floor weapon, the trio are a bright example of reggaeton's futuristic sector. —N.C. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Eliza Rose & Interplanetary Criminal - B.O.T.A. (Rosebud Recordings)
> If, when one of SASS played "B.O.T.A." at around 8 AM on the Sunday morning of Love International, someone had said to me: "This tune's going to be #1 in the UK," I probably would have laughed and suggested it was time for bed. "B.O.T.A." was the summer's most ubiquitous tune, yes, but in my universe of clubs and festivals. Or so I thought. Skip to Friday, September 2nd, 2022, and Eliza Rose & Interplanetary Criminal had scored the UK's 1,400th #1, the first-ever for a woman British DJ. The percussion is simple and buoyant, the chords are warm and the vocal is catchy as fuck; "B.O.T.A." is a flawless summer bop. —K.T. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Nia Archives - Forbidden Feelingz (HIJINXX)
> British jungle revivalist Nia Archives began her astronomical year releasing a slew of hits du jour and ended it by winning a MOBO award in the ceremony's very first electronic/dance music category. "Forbidden Feelingz," an accelerated Amen break-laden single off her eponymous EP, combines elements of dub and reggae with a distinctly rough-and-ready, old-school UK feel. Nia Archives enthusiastically borrows vintage sensibilities, so the spectre of sound system culture still haunts this one, but to a timeless and earwormy effect. —W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Maara - Lezzies In A Jacuzzi (Radiant Love)
> Montréal-based Maara has cultivated a fun and femme queer aesthetic that found an appropriate home on the Berlin label Radiant Love. Her EP on the imprint, Goddess Within, features four Goa-leaning trance tunes accompanied by whimsical titles like "Mommy's In Trouble" and "Goddess Within (Give It To Me Daddy)." But it's "Lezzies In A Jacuzzi" that takes the cake for name and substance alike. This anthem layers heavily gated vocals over a throbbing kick and swooning, euphoric pads. Thoughtfully-placed flourishes—a breakbeat fill, a call-and-response arpeggiated synth—elevate this song from cheesy crowd-pleaser to considered dance music production. If the Canadian artist is pointing her ship towards prog, then we're jumping on board. —C.L. Listen: Bandcamp / Soundcloud

### Margaret Dygas - Butterfly Effect (Half Baked Records)
> The best minimal tracks are all about attention to detail, so it should come as no surprise that Margaret Dygas' "Butterfly Effect" clocks in at 9:09. The track is immersed in the micro world of details as she dilates and contracts looped conga drums, 909s, a creeping synthline and stormy pressure from her subs. Simple but effective, Dygas approaches these elements with a surgeon's precision as she moves them up and down in the mix. This was Dygas's first 12-inch in over half a decade, a welcome return of one of minimal's weirdos-in-chief. "Butterfly Effect" is a reminder of the strange sense of wonder that only the best minimal can create, where it feels like a loop could go on forever. —H.I. Listen: Soundcloud

### Utada Hikaru - Somewhere Near Marseilles (Epic Records)
> The year's greatest grown-and-sexy jam came out of an unlikely collaboration between the biggest J-pop star of all time and UK house producer Floating Points. Starting with the flicker of an acid line, "Somewhere Near Marseilles" unfolds over 11 minutes of exquisitely produced house, bobbing and glimmering in all the right places. Hikaru sings what feels like three different choruses in a mixture of English and Japanese, glamourously exhorting their lover to meet them in Marseilles as an in-between point between London and Paris. "Let's go fast, then go slow," they repeat over the constantly morphing instrumental track. It's a snippet of luxury and contentment that feels as lush as the song sounds, only improved by Hikaru's impeccable vocal performance—the way she sings, "I'm in London / You're in Paris" is both commanding and effortlessly cool. It's rare that the pleasures of pop and house music come together this well, a cosmopolitan adult contemporary jam made for the most amourous hours of the night. —A.R. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify

### Kush Jones - BX Bounce (Self-released)
> Growing up in New York, it's nearly impossible not to be inundated by different strains of music. The summer streets come alive with reggae and hip-hop; house music wafts in through FM radio or from the cracked window of your longtime neighbour. The vital life force and diversity of the city's sounds has coloured Kush Jones's discography over the years. He typically releases music—drawing from house, jungle, footwork and hip-hop—independently at a fast clip. One of his many works from this year was 6 Days, an EP that was written in, you guessed it, six days. Within a record that shifts rapidly between house and juke, the highlight comes from the pensive pads, idle, honey-sweet melody and subtle percussion on opener "BX Bounce," embodying the very best of New York's intangible cultural heritage. —K.M. Listen: Bandcamp

### Beyoncé - BREAK MY SOUL (Columbia Records)
> When Beyoncé released the first single from her album Renaissance, souls weren't the only thing she broke. The internet, arbiter of half-baked opinions, waxed enthusiastic about house music's reinvigoration within the commercial mainstream. In many ways, "Break My Soul" was formulaic in its hitmaking: it flung gruff yak'ing samples of New Orleans bounce legend Big Freedia ("release ya trade / release the stress / release the love / forget the rest") into a looping bassline inspired by Robin S.'s 1990 smash "Show Me Love"—even tapping into the post-pandemic cultural zeitgeist of saying "fuck it" and quitting your job. But the key to any liberation anthem is confidence, not necessarily originality, and Beyoncé stands on the shoulders of the tried-and-true house heroes that came long before her to successfully ignite the masses. —W.W. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Peggy Gou - I Go (Soulwax Remix) (Gudu Records)
> In the remix circuit, Soulwax hold a god-tier status. Known for transforming pop, indie and rock classics into expansive dance music epics, the Belgian duo don't take themselves too seriously, tending to zero in on hands-in-the-air euphoria. Their reworking of Peggy Gou's "I Go," is fun-loving to the core, but it's also a potent warehouse banger. Teasing out the original's delicate vocals and retro synths against a fierce, almost mechanical bassline, the remix balances both light and heavy textures with a masterful touch. The breakdowns are on-point, the quirky bird call sample is delightful and there are no boring moments. Soulwax strikes again. —N.C. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Shanti Celeste - Cutie (Hessle Audio)
> As an illustrator, Shanti Celeste has a predilection for bright, happy hues—a blush pink to be precise, if we use her latest EP artwork as a reference. Her Hessle Audio debut adds a welcome splash of colour for the label in the form of two tracks and a Central remix that fizz with winsome positivity. Opener "Cutie" is the standout, idiosyncratically Shanti in its nimble drums and gossamer pads, with a pitched-up, corkscrew of a vocal she recorded herself. It skips along at 140 BPM, settling in the playful sweet spot where heads-down, driving house meets radiant and beatific textures. —K.T. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Skin On Skin - Burn Dem Bridges (FFRR)
> It seems unbelievable that it took someone this long to combine UK drill and techno as perfectly as this. It only took an Australian to do it. In a year that saw his star rise almost absurdly rapidly—and deservedly so—Skin On Skin blew us away with "Burn Dem Bridges," which samples a Sav'o and Horrid1 track and saddles it onto an urgent techno beat with an addictive descending bassline. The whole thing sounds ready to blow at any minute. It's remarkable how a rhythm can change the cadence of a vocal so much, and in Skin On Skin's hands, both drill and techno sound completely fresh, fiery and unstoppable. —A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Two Shell - home (Mainframe Audio)
> Impersonators showed up to their Boiler Room to play a pre-recorded set. Their first interview was taken off the internet in mere hours. Two Shell blew down the doors of 2022. And while some of their gimmicks may split opinions, "home" was a unifying track beloved by the dance music community. The single marked a new direction for the London duo, setting them apart from their peers by creating a completely singular sound where bubblegum pop meets UK bass. A frothing breakbeat at 160 BPM drives the track under its SOPHIE-reminiscent vocal, meanwhile its neon melodies burst like fireworks across the stereo spectrum. "home" will be remembered the way "Hyph Mango" was, marking the entrance into some unknown, but exciting era of UK club music. —H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### KH - Looking At Your Pager (Self-released)
> In many ways, 2022 was a massive year for pop music. Underground club producers have long played out cheeky edits of '90s chart-toppers in their DJ sets, but it felt more prominent this year. Under his KH alias, Four Tet brilliantly reworks 3LW's "No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)," autotuning the original lispy vocals against a mean bass synth and a cooing, sparkling melody that feels straight out of a nursery rhyme. It's teen pop in holy matrimony with garage-like beats, plus a faint hint of dubstep—a combination that only someone like Four Tet could pull off. —N.C. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### SHE Spells Doom - Bossano (All-centre)
> "Trying to see how African rhythms combine with techno for me is an experiment," said Wamya Tembo AKA SHE Spells Doom in an interview with the Zambian press. "[I like] seeing how far you can push it while still making people want to dance." His latest Afrobeat techno tune, "Bossano," toys with tension with the poise of a tightrope walker. Bursts of percussion ruffle the song’s militant batida march, punctuating every bar of sci-fi synths while also teasing the ruckus of a street party throughout. Like an ellipsis, it brings you to the edge of your seat—or rather, the tips of your toes. —Joseph Francis Listen: Bandcamp

### Paurro - Galavisión (Cómeme)
> This lean breakbeat house number serves as a definitive introduction to Paurro's dynamic sound. Combining UK garage and dub influences with psychedelic effects, "Galavisión" is the kind of immersive groove that lends itself to escapist fantasies. Whether hearing it at home or at the club, it's easy to be transported into a lush dream state, one where pleasure and instinct hold more currency than logic. Paurro understands the power of skippy rhythms and low-end frequencies, letting them shine without indulging in too many choppy breaks. With its clear '90s influences and rollicking drums, "Galavisión" is perfect for both peak time and after hours. —N.C. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Jennifer Loveless - Around The World (Butter Sessions)
> Galloping, loopy house abounds on this Melbourne producer's EP for home-turf label Butter Sessions. "Around The World" encapsulates the experiences of being a contemporary jetset flâneur, whose lackadaisical saunters are replaced with fast-paced globetrotting. This all seems immediately interpreted through glitchy, disembodied vocals—like filtered announcements over an intercom—and roving, rotund basslines that seem to spend the entire seven-plus minutes attempting to catch up with themselves. Loveless's perspectives bounce—quite literally—in palpable optimism. There's an dazzling array of life out there to see, and simply not enough time to see it all. —W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Joy Orbison - Pinky Ring (Hinge Finger)
> No year-end list is complete without a Joy Orbison banger. If the South Londoner's talent is distilling pockets of the hardcore continuum into original bitesize chunks, "Pinky Ring" is a particularly golden nugget. Breaks, drum & bass, post-dubstep, possibly even electro? It's all in there, and yet the track feels anything but retro. Making the past sound fresh and futuristic could well be Joy Orbison's greatest skill. —Carlos Hawthorn Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

## [The Best Albums of 2022](https://ra.co/features/4077)
Date: 2022-12-15T09:30:58.000Z

### D. Tiffany & Roza Terenzi - Edge Of Innocence (Delicate Records)
> Electronic music is something of an ouroboros: sounds hark back to the past as trends recycle in a never-ending loop. The revival of genres like jungle and trance, among others, is proof positive, and the subject of many articles from cultural critics like Simon Reynolds and Mark Fisher. But there's a distinction to be made here. Some artists' chase of rose-tinted nostalgia is nothing more than empty cliché, while others treat their return to a bygone era like a hero's journey—familiar, yet eclipsed by a new, fortified sensibility. D. Tiffany and Roza Terenzi achieve the ideal balance on their debut album, Edge Of Innocence. It offers a mélange of influences that run the hi-BPM gamut from electro to drum & bass without losing grip of the rippling, psychedelic groove at the core of everything this duo do. "Grains Of Sand" is a case in point, replete with synths that stab through a thicket of lumbering percussion, as is the fittingly named breakbeat bop "Redemption Arc," kitted out with all the sleek dynamism that emerges after a period of dark contemplation. By the end of Edge Of Innocence, you get the feeling that, though the duo are working with well-worn sounds, they've made them all their own. -Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Hudson Mohawke - Cry Sugar (Warp Records)
> Ross Birchard told us he only works up the nerve to make a solo album about every seven years, and this time it was worth the wait. Like a summary of his history of making weirdo IDM hip-hop and mainstream rap, Cry Sugar is the Glaswegian producer's most epic and wide-ranging LP, chock full of earwormy melodies, left-turn smackdowns and the symphonic pomp-and-circumstance that makes his work one of a kind. You can hear the last ten years of rap music refracted through Birchard's many-sided prism, which is often as funny as it is heavy as it is genius. Like the title implies, Cry Sugar careens from the depressed to the euphoric, each feeling pumped up to the scale of a Marvel movie. -Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Black Rave Culture - Black Rave Culture Vol. 2 (Black Rave Culture Records)
> One of the most potent club weapons this year, the second offering from Washington DC supergroup Black Rave Culture is a motley crew of historical dance music styles from across the Black diaspora. Representing East Coast club, junglist rhythms and sunny house music with a truly holistic, cross-genre vision, the album teems with grit, unbridled energy and most importantly, power. From the baile funk underpinning "Never Left" to the '90s rave ethos of "Peace Plan," these tracks jump across styles effortlessly, and the fine-tuned production of members Amal, DJ Nativesun and James Bangura holds it all together. -Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Kerri Chandler - Spaces And Places (Kaoz Theory)
> When it comes to making music, too many house and techno legends struggle to hold a candle to their younger selves. Not Kerri Chandler. The US house giant's latest album, Spaces And Places, is a three-hour epic stacked with the kind of tasty grooves and lush instrumentation we've all been gobbling up for 30 years. That its 24 tracks were mostly recorded inside the clubs and venues they pay homage to is both a remarkable feat and a quirky novelty. But it also speaks to something more profound: Chandler's global, enduring popularity. -Carlos Hawthorn Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Shygirl - Nymph (Because Music)
> As someone who's been listening to Shygirl since her breakthrough single, "Want More," it might have come as a surprise that the UK artist only released her debut album this year. But as the saying goes, good things take time. This record, aptly titled Nymph—a play on words nodding to the album's whimsical nature and bawdy undertones—is Shygirl in full effect. The vocalist's hooks are tighter than ever, and the ever-expansive production spans pastoral pop, raunchy hip-hop, nostalgic Eurodance and the kind of saccharine hyperpop that trends on TikTok. More than just an excellent first LP, Nymph is a masterclass on collaboration, boasting production credits like Sega Bodega, Arca, Mura Masa and more, whose work melts effortlessly into Shygirl's one-of-a-kind style. -Kiana Mickles Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Carmen Villain - Only Love From Now On (Smalltown Supersound)
> Norwegian musician Carmen Villain has a preternatural ability to evoke a sense of cold, uneasy beauty. Her fourth album, Only Love From Now On, features ambient compositions that are often startling in their psychological intrigue. On "Future Memory," Villain expertly braids the sounds of cooing birds, humming flutes and irregular heartbeats to build suspense. "Liminal Space" conjures something similar, except with the inclusion of what seems like faint, irregular footsteps that stumble closer and further away. With its disarming atmospherics, Villain's fourth full-length has nothing to declare—only quiet intensities to whisper. -W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Waajeed - Memoirs Of Hi-Tech Jazz (Tresor)
> Waajeed's debut on the prestigious Tresor label is a tribute to his hometown of Detroit, as a rousing tribute to both Black leisure and resistance against oppression. Conceptualised with a mini road trip around the Motor City—specifically, from the his own Underground Music Academy to Belle Isle—Memoirs Of Hi-Tech Jazz connects the dots between Detroit's rich musical traditions, encompassing jazz, deep house, minimal techno and marching band music. Even the title, a reference to the Underground Resistance subgroup Galaxy 2 Galaxy, reflects Detroit's storied sonic lineage. Proud, joyous and unapologetically local, Waajeed's love letter to his hometown is packed with velvety tones and lustrous chords that acknowledge the past and pave the way for the future. -N.C. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Marina Herlop - Pripyat (PAN)
> Do you ever wonder how the world looks through a baby's eyes? Everything's new, and nothing makes sense. It's just one brilliant, ever-shifting mirage of colour and sound. Marina Herlop's third album, Pripyat, dazzles in a similar way. Where the Catalan artist's first two records showed off her expert piano playing and freeform, wordless vocals, Pripyat goes a step further into the unknown, patching together her classical training with dissonant electronics, and even weaving in an ancient Indian singing style called konnakol. The album might share its name with a ghost town, but Herlop's Pripyat is alive and bright with boundless imagination. -Joseph Francis Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Whatever The Weather - Whatever The Weather (Ghostly International)
> While Loraine James was working on her acclaimed 2021 LP Reflections, Loraine James filed away several songs that would ultimately make up her self-titled album, Whatever The Weather. On this meteorology-themed album, James did away with her club sound completely to write a series of ambient tracks distinguished by a worn, melancholy beauty. Here, intermittent rain is depicted as a flurry of lustrous synths, "14°C" is transformed into pensive arpeggios—the playfully jagged IDM she's revered for—and sounds hiccup and stop-start across placid pads all over the LP. As an artist whose main project emphasises tricky beats over strikingly subdued terrain, her pivot to producing a downtempo record—and doing it so well—makes perfect sense. -K.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Soichi Terada - Asakusa Light (Rush Hour Music)
> Before this album, Japan's deep house don hadn't released a full-length in over 25 years. But it's abundantly clear that he hasn't lost his touch. There's a light, almost weightless, feel to this 11-track LP as the Tokyo composer and producer shows off his mastery of twinkling chords, spacey disco grooves, vintage synth patterns and video game sounds. Asakusa Light is relatively sparse—even its big-room tracks like "Bamboo Fighter" feature relatively minimal arrangements—which allows his signature melodies to really shine. Graceful and flowing, this is an album that celebrates Terada's craft without feeling like a pastiche of his '90s discography. -N.C. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Marcel Dettmann - Fear Of Programming (Dekmantel)
> Marcel Dettmann has always earned more attention for his DJing than his productions, but real fans know that his discography is a treasure trove of dark, detailed techno. Fear Of Programming, which lands on the all-purpose Dekmantel label, is something different: bright, vibrant, even a little funny (thanks to a vocal guest spot from fellow Berghain resident Ryan Elliott). Fear Of Programming is loaded with bold, bassy techno and arresting ambient passages. The real gold is in the hooks, which the spartan but still powerful production emphasizes like a gold frame around a masterpiece painting. It's the work of someone who knows techno inside-out, and knows how to make it compelling without going too far outside the box. -A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Hagan - Textures (Python Syndicate)
> With his debut album Textures, the South London DJ and producer Hagan celebrates the intersecting cultures close to his heart with rich, percussion-driven music. Organic flourishes (Ghanaian group chants, windswept koras and sunny guitar lines, to name a few) broaden the horizons of his historically urban sound palette, and he truly comes into his own as an all-around songwriter. With expertly curated vocal collaborations that reflect on family and faith, elements of gqom, amapiano and highlife, Textures is a transportive ode to the drumming continent, and the meaning of growing up both within and away from it. One moment you're in a lush, jungly landscape, the next you're hustling in the streets of Accra. Textures is more than just African dance music; it's a vibrant amalgamation of all the ingredients and influences that make Brendan Ware Hagan. -Emeka.Okonkwo. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Deepchord - Functional Designs (Soma Records)
> All of Deepchord's records are good—all of them—but a few are extra special. Functional Designs falls into this category. On first glance, it's not all that different from his countless other LPs. You've got gaseous dub techno beats echoing out into a painstakingly woven web of field recordings, sure. But the melodies are bigger, the drums are heavier and, most importantly, the tracks are separate, each with its own hook, its own uniquely staggered rhythm. Creating another noir-ish world of rainy-night ambiance, Functional Designs is one of Deepchord's most approachable and immersive LPs, gently refurbishing the rock solid formula of dub techno that the Detroit artist has relied on for decades. -A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Björk - Fossora (One Little Independent)
> Björk spent a lot of time dancing and thinking about mushrooms during lockdown. From this—a time she described to Pitchfork as her "fungus period"—came Fossora, the Icelandic vanguard's tenth album. Björk has been making music for over three decades now, and with each record she steps into mystical, uncharted territory, creating work which is ever more beguiling, more avant-garde and always, somehow, even more Björk. On Fossora, Björk sings with a sweeping gravitas over rich woodwinds and distorted gabber beats, the additional instrumentation dancing around her vocal as she muses on the circle of life, nature and her own late mother. Digging her fingers into the earth, Björk unknots tributaries of tangled roots, the crashing drum patterns and complex textures representing the stark, breathtaking topography of her homeland. -Katie Thomas Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Huerco S. - Plonk (Incensio)
> From the first three seconds of Plonk, you know Huerco S. isn't doing the misty ambient thing again. Plucked strings ping in various directions, like popcorn exploding in a pan. Or, to be more accurate, like parts of a car yawning into gear. The automotive-inspired album, his first in six years, takes the American artist's sound to strange and innovative places—new sounds, unexpected textures, a first-ever vocal cameo. Isn't this what great artists do? Evolve, take left turns and, crucially, always deliver. -C.H. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Kode9 - Escapology (Hyperdub)
> Britain has never felt so close to collapse as it did in 2022. Between prime minister jockeying, mini-budgets and a volatile currency, Steven Goodman returned as Kode9 with a record that made the perfect accompaniment for the instability of the modern UK landscape. Written to accompany an experimental video game about Scotland leaving the union, Escapology operates along a dual axis, at once anxious—filled with eerie bits of sci-fi chatter and dense layers of swelling feedback—but also hopeful, at least when he turns to club tracks. "Uncoil," for example, is a pearl half-covered in sand somewhere between drum & bass and footwork, while "Cross The Gap" uses the negative space of dub to create something glimmering in the weight of the darkness around it. -Henry Ivy Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### DJ Lag - Meeting With The King (Ice Drop)
> After years pushing the Durban scene and helping to make the sound a global sensation, anticipation for DJ Lag's debut album, Meeting With The King, was sky-high. He used the opportunity to champion his community instead of his own glory, creating a record that is collaborative from start to finish, with a majority focus on artists hailing from his home country of South Africa. Meeting With The King takes the moody sonics of the gqom—born from township house parties—and makes it polished, opulent, even melodic, honouring the origins of the sound while adding catchy elements of amapiano, house, Afrotech and more. The title is boastful, but it's not wrong—on Meeting With The King, DJ Lag stakes his claim and continues his ascent, taking his musical family along for the ride. -K.T. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify

### Schacke - Apocalyptic Decadence (Instruments Of Discipline)
> Martin Schacke—of "Kisloty People" fame—has a knack for writing a hook. And almost every track of his debut album is decadent and addictive, loaded with catchy melodies. While the first half of the release gestures towards new beat and EBM—"Miasma Of Filth" and "Tasteless Passion" both pull from a lineage of tinny 808s and mid-tempo industrial—the second half offers grade-A techno-pop made for the the dance floor. Songs like "Body Type" and "Dungeon Crawler" are deceptively simple production-wise, but their repetitive choruses are the stuff that makes crossover hits. It's easy to imagine waiting for the train in the early morning hours after the rave, deliriously looping these brash three-note motifs again and again through your head. -Chloe Lula Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Ron Trent presents WARM - What Do The Stars Say To You (Night Time Stories)
> Ron Trent's WARM project captures it all in the name. As the Chicago house genius has advanced in his career, he's slowly luxuriated into a silky fusion sound that plucks from jazz, Balearic and soft rock in the spirit of carefully considered collaborators, like Texan psych-rock trio Khruangbin or Italian ambient composer Gigi Masin. "Admira," for instance, unfurls alongside loose bongo drums like a satisfying slow yawn after a midday slumber. Dappled sunlight patchworks "Flos Potentia," bound together by strumming bass guitar, and "On My Way Home," an earnest, jazzy sonic panacea for the oft-jaded ennui of modern music. After a long 11 years away from the format, Trent's latest album is a gorgeous evolution to behold. -W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Jamal Moss - Thanks 4 The Tracks U Lost (Modern Love)
> Jamal Moss, under his own name and as Hieroglyphic Being, is one of the defining forces in Chicago dance music. Whether he's making jacking house, experimental noise or blown-out techno, his work is defined by its sense of pure energy as he whips his machines into a frenzy. You'll find plenty of that rawness on his first LP for Modern Love, but where Thanks 4 The Tracks U Lost stands apart is in its surprising tenderness. Don't get me wrong—the drums have plenty of edge, and Moss still pushes his synthesizers to their breaking points—but the record is strikingly wistful, making for one of the most beautiful and tenderhearted of the many albums he's released. -H.I. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Beast Nest - Sicko (Ratskin Records)
> In their work as an organiser and mediator, Beast Nest, AKA Sharmi Basu, believes that healing should be a communal effort. The process for making Sicko could be described as a collective effort. The LP was recorded in the years following 2016's tragic Ghost Ship fire, which ended up killing 36 people in an unlicensed warehouse. Sicko was an integral part of their healing journey as a survivor. There's palpable catharsis written into the energetic pulse of the album, which bleeds several genres into a satisfyingly cohesive mix that makes it difficult to discern where one song ends and another begins. Ambient sequences with knotty sections that twinkle and flutter turn into spaced out dub and then, somewhere along the way, listeners are transported to post-punk-leaning IDM. The songs sprawl out slowly, but capped at six tracks, the LP is actually quite short, emblematic of the slowness of grief and the unpredictable, dynamic moments that accompany it. -K.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Sudan Archives - Natural Brown Prom Queen (Stones Throw)
> Sudan Archives has always been a jewel of eccentricity. On her boundless second album, Natural Brown Prom Queen, rewind-worthy lyrics, maximalist experimentation (and what might be the most beat switches per song this year) coalesce into one remarkable document of self-empowerment and discovery. She embodies both her inner child and the person she's becoming ("I just wanna build LEGOs / I just wanna build, let's go"), all while keeping her signature sultriness dialed up to the max. Even putting her signature violin to the sidelines doesn't distract from her unique songwriting style. By the time she brings it home on the closer, "#513," she's delivered a defiant manifesto of hedonism, joy and femininity that raises the bar when it comes to post-genre pop music. -E.O. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Tanya Tagaq - Tongues (Six Shooter)
> Amid an ongoing reckoning with Canada's own history of indigenous genocide, Inuk artist Tanya Tagaq's sixth album approaches this legacy with righteous fury and surprising tenderness. An extension of a book of verse of the same name, Tongues takes stock of decades of violence and its effects on the bodies and minds of a people, but also recognizes the power one can possess in even the most hopeless of circumstances. Combining her traditional throat singing with English words wielded like daggers, it's a disarming and personal listen that makes the historical personal, underlining the scale of a tragedy but also the resilience and power of those who have survived it. -A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Steffi - The Red Hunter (Candy Mountain)
> For the past five years, Steffi has been refining a style of electro that sits somewhere between bruising club weaponry and crystalline IDM sound design. The Red Hunter broadens this palette to include touches of hip-hop and contemporary club music, while keeping the nuts and bolts of classic Detroit in place. The result is the best full-length of her career. On The Red Hunter she creates a singular cosmology where strange, stuttering drum patterns emerge underneath windswept melodies and contracting basslines. But even as she moves into far-flung realms, she never loses sight of the club, and almost every single one of these tracks would make a head-turning standout in a DJ set—which is what we've always come to Steffi for in the first place. -H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Mall Grab - What I Breathe (Looking For Trouble)
> In just a few years, Mall Grab went from master of a niche to king of everything. His debut album is a Chemical Brothers-sized crossover behemoth, attacking every form of radio-friendly dance music, from big room house to pounding jungle. It's inspired by the sounds of his adopted home of London, and to his credit, it captures what makes the city so enduring in dance music history. A restless blend of sound system culture, American and European imports and the kind of vocal hooks you hear on BBC Radio 1—with a few vocal turns from the man himself—it transforms Mall Grab from bedroom producer into something closer to a pop star. -A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Dopplereffekt - Neurotelepathy (Leisure System)
> Gerald Donald and To-Nhan Le Thi of Dopplerekkeft's second LP, like many 2022 albums, emerged from the toils of pandemic-induced isolation. The album's accompanying press text loftily asserts that its ten tracks are "considerations of the machine-human interface" and "transformative mental, psychological and transgenerational states." While some of these (perhaps overwrought) academic themes come through in the album's titles, it mostly sounds like the duo's mood piece-like electro fare—in the best possible way. The tracks throughout Neurotelepathy aren't predictable arrangements made for club play. They're spare and considered, making exquisite use of spatial sound design, spectral percussion and arpeggiated melodies. Some songs, like "EEG," take more than a minute to settle into a more legible song structure, but their expertly rendered craftsmanship make them worth the wait. -C.L. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### 700 Bliss - Nothing To Declare (Hyperdub)
> Spoken word and darbuka drums join in holy matrimony on this joint album from 700 Bliss—Philadelphia-based Moor Mother and DJ Haram. As the first full-length work from the duo after a series of collaborative EPs, Nothing To Declare sees the two artists claiming their matriarchal stake in electronic music. Haram's frenetic electronics speak in dialogue with Moor Mother's throaty vocals, delivered with a potent urgency. "Things ain't been the same since they put the lynch on us / water thicker than blood they convinced us," Ayewa opines. She's always been fearless in her delivery, but it's Muzeyyen's jagged productions that drive the point home. -W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### ABADIR - Mutate (SVBKVLT)
> SVBKVLT became one of the most important club music labels by showcasing the vital Shanghai club scene, though the label's purview has expanded and only become more vibrant in the process. Case in point: this LP from Cairo producer ABADIR, which combines a freewheeling style of jungle with Arabic rhythms. This is music that sounds permanently out of breath, feeding off its own excitable energy. Inspired by maqsoum music and the humid bustle of the Egyptian capital, Mutate features impossibly funky beats shrouded in thick field recordings and melodies that hang in the air like smog. It's a vision of the kind of global club music that SVBKVLT has always championed, and one of the best records in a catalogue that constantly ups the ante for where club music can go next. -A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Batu - Opal (Timedance)
> According to the International Gem Society, an opal is "distinctly individual"—more so than any other gemstone. The 3D-rendered opal on the cover of Batu's debut album is just that: a unique kaleidoscope of colours. Icy blue, vibrant green and a hot, lava red contrast with the grey underside of the opal and the moody background. Examining Opal's cover gives a strong sense of the sounds within. 11 tracks of sharp (though sometimes soft), complex and unpredictable electronic sculptures, a world of intricate sound design that Batu said he intended to feel vivid and transportive. Like so many LPs released this year, Opal is a lockdown record, made when Batu was in an introspective and contemplative state of mind, experimenting with moving away from club 12-inches and into a space more vulnerable and experimental. -K.T. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### FKA twigs - Caprisongs (Young)
> Caprisongs was one of the first RA Recommends of the year, and it was no surprise to many of us that it lingered long enough in our minds to make this end of year list. The album is brighter than anything we'd heard from twigs before. Gone is the operatic austerity of MAGDALENE. Instead, Caprisongs is a pop album with a capital P. The album mines from Afrobeats, grime, baile funk and R&B. It also sources from her personal life via snippets of conversations she recorded with loved ones. The immersive world she creates here deals with insecurity, "stupid boys" and friendship, but it's also celebratory. The world had opened up, after all. Twigs might have had a cry now and then, but at least she was doing it on the dance floor in the album's first single, "Tears In The Club.". As phenomenal as Caprisongs is, it's somehow even more impressive because it was pulled off with a welcome sense of humour. The album title, for example, is inspired by astrology—her "stubborn Caprisun ass telling her to work through the pain." Listeners can even eavesdrop on an astrological reading by the album's close. Sometimes, a little stubbornness is worth it. -K.M. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

## [The Best Mixes of 2021](https://ra.co/features/3952)
Date: 2021-12-22T13:00:01.000Z

### Presents: Eargoggles (Theo Parrish)
> "There are no genres. Nope, there's none. It's all tune for tune," Theo Parrish said outside the familiar NTS stall in Dalston's Gillett Square. And he doesn't just talk to talk. Many DJs claim to play across genres, but there are "many DJs" and then there is Theo Parrish. Over the past few years, the historically private artist has given fans a near-unprecedented view into his creative mind, first with the lengthy and unclassifiable sonic essay-meets-radio drama We Are All Georgeous Monsterss, and then this year with a six-and-a-half hour mix for NTS called "Eargoggles." (Parrish also dropped another six-hour mix close to press time.) Eargoggles is a marathon celebration of the infinite diversity of Black music, spanning from hard bop to hip-hop, searing psych rock to roots reggae. No random grab bag, this is a grand narrative and the revelation of a modern canon of soul with appearances by James Brown, The Congos and D'Angelo. The mix is an education unto itself—around hour five Parrish drops "Jazz Cats Part 1," a cut consisting of Madlib breathlessly laying out his key jazz influences—yet it's also a generous statement of purpose bursting with joy and urgency. 25 years into his career, Parrish gives us an exhaustive guide to the music that makes him tick, that has informed his own enduring classics. But why now? He explains the gravity of his convictions in the final moment of the magisterial "Eargoggles" mix: I'm hoping that at some point during this... After you've had a ride, a musical ride with me, that you take a moment to consider the troubles that you have, and consider that you're lucky to have them. Even if it doesn't affect you demographically, you should seriously consider the fact that there's an urgency that should be lived, in respect for those that get taken from us early under the guise of 'serve and protect.' So let's survive together. But let's remember them together as well. Let's not forget how we treat each other when the music's playing and how things change when the lights go on and we all go back to the rest of our lives. Let's go back with a little more urgency and care for the fellow man. Let's give a damn a little bit. And if we can do that, we got a better place.—Matt McDermott

### BIS Radio Show #1085 (Tim Sweeney)
> Over the past 21 years, Tim Sweeney never missed a week on the WNYU airwaves, hosting generations of DJs in the college station's basement studios. Beats In Space became iconic over this decades-long stretch, with Sweeney joining a grand tradition of New York radio DJs that also includes Shep Pettibone, Tony Humphries, Stretch and Bobbito, who held sway and influence far beyond the five boroughs. Though Sweeney has since brought Beats In Space back via Apple Music, last March he unexpectedly wrapped up his term on WNYU with episode #1085. Listeners flooded the comment section on a YouTube livestream after the news broke, thanking him for his illustrious tenure. For the finale, Sweeney played Beats In Space classics that highlighted the show's connection to the history of New York City dance music, dropping in an eclectic selection from Alicia Myers, Chaz Jankel and Arnold Jarvis. Full of hope, the two-and-a-half hours imparts a heartfelt message of gratitude to dedicated listeners and guests alike.—M.M.

### borshch mix 26 (Crystallmess)
> We're in the age of the polymath musician, and Crystallmess is the epitome. The French-born Ivorian and Guadeloupean DJ, producer and mixed media artist (who has shown her work at the Centre Pompidou and the Geneva Biennale, as well as playing at hallowed institutions like Berghain), has steadily made her way into the art and electronic music vanguards simultaneously. For her entry in the Borshch Magazine series, Crystallmess uses the mix format to express the social whiplash of lockdowns and reopenings, all the while showing off her agile genre-agnosticism. She includes edits of beloved Lil Wayne and Aaliyah tracks, blown-out jungle sampling "Ready or Not" by The Fugees, swirled with a heavy-handed dose of otherworldly ambient to evoke the expansive solitude of pandemic isolation.—Whitney Wei

### Lost In Dreams (Irini)
> Lost In Dreams was another entry in the growing SoundCloud archive of Traumprinz's resplendent multiverse. Irini, one of the elusive artist's many pseudonyms, trots out over three hours worth of new material, charting a comprehensive course in sensitive dance music from someone who creates at a relentless pace. Unlike some of his other aliases, irini doesn't have a unique sound in the way that DJ Healer or the Prince Of Denmark do, but that's also what makes this mix so rewarding. The dub techno, UK garage, even minimal house productions spring forth from an enigmatic source, keeping the intrigue of listening alive. Now it's just a matter of waiting for the inevitable vinyl releases.—Henry Ivry

### ETCHED 003 (Live Set) (Wata Igarashi)
> A live set from techno's undisputed master of arpeggios, Wata Igarashi, is a special thing no matter where it takes place: dark basements or—why not—the Nobeyama Radio Observatory. Located in Yatsugatake, Japan, the observatory has been a hub for radio astronomy research since 1982. Its imposing rows of satellites and telescopes, set against a beautiful landscape, provide an almost too-good-to-be-true backdrop for Igarashi's cosmic, otherworldly sound. Beautifully shot on video by ETCHED (an audiovisual project showcasing domestic artists), the set plunges into the outer reaches of Igarashi's unmistakable productions, reworking previous records and some unreleased material into an hour-long trip that remains one of 2021's most memorable techno sets.—Richard Akingbehin

### 100% UNRELEASED OSSX MIX (OSSX)
> For many of us, New Jersey group OSSX's "Split Wig" on Allergy Season was one of the year's indisputable anthems. And the only thing better than just one track is a whole hour of exclusive material. 100% UNRELEASED OSSX is a goldmine for anyone into big drums and even bigger melodies (with a "Split Wig" appearance early on). There's a light-footed touch to breakbeats, plus some nimble choppage and a parade of brazen, uplifting edits that sample a tongue-in-cheek gamut: Modjo to Janet Jackson to September's Eurodance hit "Cry For You." It's that "Are they really doing this? Sampling that?" swagger that cinches this mix as one of our endlessly replayable favorites this past year.—Andrew Ryce

### TTT Mixtape (Josey Rebelle)
> Josey Rebelle could—and probably will, honestly—make this list every year for the foreseeable future, and it would be nothing short of deserved. The UK DJ is one of the best selectors on the planet, with a record digger's taste but a party-rocker's ear. She'll play obscure records, sure, but they'll never feel obscure. Her mix, first released as a very limited tape on The Trilogy Tapes in April, is a perfect example of this, stitching together slow jams, weirdo techno and even snippets of radio play, with a darker edge than what we're used to from some of Rebelle's recent mixes. The eventual streaming upload of the mix was greeted with the fervor of an album drop, and for good reason: this TTT Mix strums the eclectic but intuitive thread that’s tied through all of her sets. The only flaw is that it isn't twice as long.—A.R.

### GHOSTCAST 014 (DESYN)
> In certain circles, the name Desyn Masielo commands a kind of reverence, and the London lifer has been blending the finest never-on-YouTube Discogs gems for the past two decades. Here, Masiello flaunts those deep-digging DJ tendencies with wild abandon. Ghostcast14, recorded live at Hoppetosse, is a good intro to what he can achieve when he goes for the jugular from the very beginning. We start in medias res with UK garage basslines, but his masterful pacing and mixing means that before we know it, we're zipping through starry rave, acidic electro, '90s house and just about everything else under the sun. For us mortal trainspotters, the only thing worse than having missed this party is that we'll likely never know what any of these records are.—H.I.

### Daisychain 154 (DJ Fart In The Club)
> DJ Fart In The Club (AKA Soyoon Choi) certainly has an offbeat sense of humor, but when it comes to their DJ sets, they're entirely straight-faced. Even though this set came in at the tail end of last year, it still banged all the way through into 2021. The Berlin artist unleashes a sticky hour-and-a-half of acid-tinged wobblers, prog house and freaky trance for the Chicago-based, women and non-binary focused podcast series Daisychain. In the knottier sections, Choi takes listeners on a jaunt full of vertiginous peaks and deep valleys by roving into spiraling wormholes of techno, garage and preternatural club music.—Kiana Mickles

### sit on my interface (1/2) (CCL)
> In the weeds of the first 20 minutes of CCL's sit on my interface mix, it's easy to presume that this is a fully ambient offering. But that would be a hasty judgement, as once it approaches the one-hour mark, the energy intensifies with such careful, gradual restraint that even the active listener might wonder how they even got to this point. Sure enough, the mix ultimately reaches a dark, slinky plateau with a bubbling, percussive roller and then rockets off from there. "sit on my interface (2/2)" can't arrive soon enough.—K.M.

## [The Best Tracks of 2021](https://ra.co/features/3951)
Date: 2021-12-21T00:47:34.000Z

### Overmono - So U Kno (Poly Kicks)
> 2021 felt like Overmono's breakthrough year. Each new release of theirs seemed to outdo the last, from the euphoric rave of "Pieces Of 8" to their pitch-perfect fabric mix to the peppy garage of "Diamond Cut" (one of the major highlights from what was arguably the year's best Essential Mix). But it was "So U Kno," released not on the duo's usual home of XL Recordings but on their own, smaller Poly Kicks imprint, that made it into what felt like every DJ set of the post-reopening world. Like so much of Overmono's recent work, there's a whiff of a bygone, post-dubstep era to "So U Know." Built around an unforgettable vocal chop, "So U Kno" is the kind of track that elicits cheers from a dance floor the minute the DJ starts to mix it in. It has one of those in-between beats—kind of house, kind of 2-step, kind of techno—and a thrill-ride of a breakdown. Encapsulating the frenzied, overjoyed vibe of the summer's post-reopening clubbing with a hint of wistful nostalgia, "So U Kno" perfectly sums up this year's excitement and radical ups and downs.—Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Billie Eilish - Oxytocin (Interscope Records)
> Hidden in the middle of Billie Eilish's intimate, often confessional singer-songwriter album is one of the year's biggest, loudest club tracks: the pop megastar's equivalent of Nine Inch Nails' "Closer." "Cause I like to do things God wouldn't approve of / If she saw us," Eilish whispers over a clanging, outsized beat. "Oxytocin" takes the tactile, goosebump-inducing approach of Eilish's other records and blows it up to a macro scale. It's the sound of being cornered in the club, pushed towards the speaker until all you can hear are the kick drums.—A.R. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Elvin T - Get Close (Regraded)
> Throw a jacking house rhythm underneath the right vocal and soaring strings, and you've found yourself a tried and true way to excite a dance floor. There is nothing radical or even innovative about Elvin T's "Get Close," which hews closely to this time-honored formula, but there doesn't need to be. The Philadelphia producer laced together the perfect combination of driving percussion, vocals, a glossy string loop and a couple of breakdowns. Released as the final record on Midland's Regraded label at the start of summer, the track's timing was also fortuitous as dance floors got busier over the summer. —Henry Ivry Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### PinkPantheress - Just for me (Parlophone)
> TikTok made PinkPantheress one of the year's defining pop stars. She became a musical sensation just for releasing snippets of songs on the video app before the full versions appeared on streaming services. Anyone who hadn't heard of PinkPantheress probably did when she finally released the music video for "Just for me," an early '00s-inspired visual depicting her on a studio stage with a sulky crew of emo kids. The Mura Masa co-produced track nodded to garage and early '00s pop-rock, perfectly encapsulating "new nostalgic," a term PinkPantheress uses to describe her own sound. If the lyrics—which follow a stalker's infatuation with a crush—are unsettling, it's intentional. The song was inspired by the obsessive themes that run through Eminem's "Stan," and is more a practice in dramatic storytelling than a portrayal of real-life events. Much like the rest of her catalog, which is tailor-made for bright-eyed Gen Z TikTokers with short attention spans and a love for danceable, snappy hooks, "Just for me" hovers around two minutes in length—just long enough to make you want to press rewind and hear it all over again.—Kiana Mickles Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Planetary Assault Systems - Say It Loud (Token)
> As Planetary Assault Systems, Luke Slater makes huge, no-bullshit techno. There's plenty of technical wizardry going on, sure, but you know what to expect: thunderdome kick drums and synths that sound like sonar pings. Enter "Say It Loud," the highlight from Belgian label Token's 100th release, which subverts Slater's historical output with a goofy sound that matches its goofy title (right down to the deadpan vocal repeating "say it loud"). Refreshing and zippy, it sounds a bit like Slater poking fun at the current crop of big-time techno producers, then beating them at their own game with a track that's over-the-top, funky and absolutely monstrous.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Soundcloud / Spotify / Soundcloud

### tondiue - Painted Creature (secondnature)
> tondiue's debut packed an album's worth of ideas into an EP of techno that explores the outer reaches of the genre, specifically slowed-down breakbeats and tunneling, Wata Igarashi-style arpeggio workouts. "Painted Creature" falls somewhere between these styles. What starts out as a loose hand percussion workout laced with clipped, unnerving vocal samples before the breakdown turns it into a tripped-out big room techno cut that could stand up with the best of 'em. It's just one of many highlights on a techno EP that sticks with us like few others have this year.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Nia Archives - Headz Gone West (HIJINXX)
> Drum & bass was all over pop and R&B this year, though it rarely sounded as heavy and convincing as it did on Nia Archives' Headz Gone West, where the London singer peppers expert breakbeat chop-ups with jazzy vocal runs. The title track is an easy highlight, packing a whole lot into just over two minutes as Nia Archives sings about her anxiety, her wandering mind and getting "high just to pass the time" over beats that crest and wane like lashing ocean waves.—A.R. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / SoundCloud

### Stef Mendesidis - Stalker (Klockworks)
> Like his first EP for Ben Klock's label in 2019, Greek born, Kyiv-based producer Stef Mendesidis' Klockworks 33 delivered four irresistibly catchy, full-pelt techno tracks when it came out in October. "Stalker" is by far the most elegant cut of the batch, threading delicate hats and a single, sonorous pad in and out of an arpeggiated bassline that opens and closes over the course of five-and-a-half minutes. Like Klock, Mendesidis has mastered the art of functional peak-time techno that feels anthemic despite its simplicity.—Chloe Lula Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Logic1000 - I Won't Forget (Therapy)
> Logic1000's "I Won't Forget" had unfortunate timing, landing at the very beginning of the year when most of the world was still shut down. It has all the makings of a festival hit with its deliciously heavy slo-mo breakbeat and moody synths that come in halfway through the track, like tears blurring your peripheral version. Just when you think you have the track pegged down, everything falls away to reveal a truly evil-sounding Reese bassline that pushes it to another level. In all, it's a wonderful, canny fusion of UK dance music styles from a talented Australian producer.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### John Glacier - If Anything (PLZ Make It Ruins)
> "If Anything" producer and Frank Ocean collaborator Vegyn originally found John Glacier's music on SoundCloud, but the London-based artists quickly realized they'd met before, gravitating towards each other to chat at the back of parties. It's appropriate, then, that "If Anything," the opening salvo from Glacier's debut album, brims with the swooning disorientation of a big night out. Over a triumphant, boom bap-influenced beat, Glacier raps in impressionistic turns of phrase: "Starlight, dancin' in the moon / I'm ravin' rabbit, I'm on shroom." "If Anything" introduces a visionary and arty MC with an instantly recognizable banger.—Matt McDermott Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### KG - Koko feat. Mista Silva (Black Acre)
> Karen Nyame KG earned the nickname "The Goddess of Rhythm" for her intricate UK funky productions, but the British-Ghanaian artist's biggest track to date came when she stepped up to the mic. "Koko" was an immediate summer hit that benefited from a magpie's approach to recent African dance music innovations. In just under three minutes, Nyame mixes airy highlife guitar, Afrobeats and amapiano. Her vocal, meanwhile, is unapologetically carnal: "Don't waste my time / I wanna bust down, bust down / Go rounds, go rounds / lights out, lights out." Modern dance music often feels like it's designed for some airless dungeon. By comparison, "Koko" feels like sex on the beach.—M.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Koreless - Joy Squad (Young)
> It's safe to say the Welsh producer Koreless got a little in his head while working on his debut album, which was almost a decade in the making. The time enabled him to do endless revisions and embark on creative soul-searching that eventually paid off. The LP's ten tracks display extraordinary sonic detail and inventiveness. "Joy Squad" sticks out as a granular reimagining of a big room anthem. Chopped-up shards of melody and vocals combine with cinematic strings in a kaleidoscopic funhouse of a track that would be overwhelming if it wasn't so concise.—M.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Maxwell Sterling - Decay Time (AD 93)
> Turn Of Phrase reveals Maxwell Sterling as a rare talent, remarkably adept in both electronic sound design and orchestral arrangement. While the title track flabbergasts with a mix of furious classical runs and Autechre-level sound processing, the brief "Decay Time" is the record's centrepiece. While the drums clearly hearken back to IDM's '90s heyday, the track's plinking synth bass and strings converge to evoke a sense of deep lament. This difficult balance of head-spinning programming and lilting emotionality recalls classics within the genre like Aphex Twin's "Flim."—M.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / SoundCloud

### DJ Black Low & Kapzela feat. Licy Jay & MLG - Emonate Oe Bethela D Vosho (Awesome Tapes From Africa)
> Considering house and techno are inventions of the African diaspora, it feels like poetic justice that some of the most innovative changes happening in modern electronic music are emerging from the continent. In recent years, amapiano's log drum grooves have sprung from Gauteng townships to clubs around the world. DJ Black Low, the 20-year-old amapiano producer signed to Awesome Tapes From Africa, brought an experimental edge to the young genre on his 2021 album, Uwami. On "Emonate Oe Bethela D Vosho," Black Low works with Kapzela and the MCs Licy Jay & MLG to forge a groove that's as urgent as it is inviting.—M.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Currency Audio - Modus Choperandi (Exit Records)
> Photek's 1997 hit "Modus Operandi" brought together the best parts of trip-hop, jazz, jungle and hip-hop. Consisting mostly of drums and atmospheric effects, it redefined drum & bass and celebrated the art of percussion itself. On his entirely improvised tribute to the track, Rajeev Maddela pulled from Photek's beat science, fusing recreated '90s breakbeats with live drumming and his own signature sound. Maddela's razor-sharp instrumentation—accentuated by ghostly pads—brought new depths to jazzy drum & bass this year.—Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Max Watts - Hipnautic (Self-released)
> Only recently exiting his teenage years, rising techno prodigy Max Watts has released some of the freshest renditions of Detroit techno this year. His self-described "post-Detroit" style is unique for its raw, improvisational flow, channeling the freewheeling energy of Midwestern techno greats like Underground Resistance, Claude Young and DJ Rush. Watts's sincere investment in the emotion and groove behind his music makes way for some of the purest and most exuberant modern techno around. One of the hits off April's MW002 EP, "Hipnautic," was a favorite for its lurching percussion, drunken, loopy melody and dissipating hi-hats. Watts knows how to build and retract momentum in all the right places.—K.M. Listen: Bandcamp

### Bapari - Daybreak (Self-released)
> The "Ha" stab, a rousing "crash" sample that typically falls on the 4, is to ballroom music as vocal chops are to Jersey club. They're classic hallmarks of the genres—once you hear them, it's difficult to mistake what you're listening to. The key elements of ballroom music, a style intrinsically tied to its dance culture, have understandably caught the eye of numerous club producers in recent years. And Bapari, a Brooklyn-based artist whose music draws from all manner of East Coast club styles, is one of the latest to be inspired. On the title track of their Daybreak EP, the "Ha" stab, rather than assuming its traditional role of accentuating the melody, becomes the melody across a frenzy of playful, whip-sawing crashes. Offering some respite, Bapari skillfully tempered the track with plenty of space and the occasional murmuring vocal that floats off into the ether.—K.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Ayesha - Potential Energy (Scuffed Recordings)
> There are a few simple but essential ingredients needed to make the perfect Ayesha track: nimble percussion, intoxicatingly psychedelic melodies and plenty of focus on the low-end. "Potential Energy" nails all three. The first gobsmacking moment arrives with synths that ripple with the intensity of an ultraviolet wave. Then the first acid lead slithers in, a portent of the brilliance to come: a rip-roaring showcase of lumbering breakbeats and off-kilter synths, replete with Saturday morning cartoon sound effects. It's a certified energy-boosting weapon for DJs on the late-late shift.—K.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### A.G - always, you (Self-released)
> Breakout artist A.G not only has a penchant for creating robust, propulsive sounds, but she's got the bravura to back it up. Last year, the East London native postedMixmag's review of her August Discwoman selections, including the tongue-in-cheek caption "heavy-bodied means I'm thick." It's quips like these—and all the offerings on her donotdisturb EP—that shirk the stereotype of the introverted bedroom producer. In standout track "always, you," A.G demonstrates a magisterial command of UK drill, directing staccato hi-hats and pitched-up vocal samples to clamber over heavy bass uppercuts with a tenacity that matches her personality. When they say "confidence is everything," take this example as a case in point.—Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp / Spotify

### UNIIQU3 - Microdosing (Local Action)
> When Jersey club royalty holds court, the world pays attention. Cherise Gray, otherwise known as UNIIQU3, has been championing the 135 BPM club music of her Newark home on the international stage for the better part of a decade, and this year she really came into her own. "Microdosing," the lead single off her Heartbeats EP, delves into house, rap and four-to-the-floor big room beats: "Took a tab and tripped / Drown in it / Fall into my abyss / The sticky icky wet wet." Gray details a lysergic wet dream that climaxes at peak time on the dance floor. Synth-heavy and oozing with confidence, the track holds the hip-swinging sashay of a lip glossed, sugar-coated seduction—without the predictable box spring squeaks.—W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Blawan - Under Belly (XL Recordings)
> "Under Belly" has a little bit of everything that we've come to love about Jamie Roberts (AKA Blawan), from his early Hessle Audio days to his tech-wiz modular techno era. It also perfectly captures what has always been refreshing about his music: He never takes himself too seriously. With its groovy swing and ghost choir motif, "Under Belly" sounds like the most fun he's ever had on record. By looking back to his early days as an honorary post-dubstep protege, Roberts proves he can return to the past while still firmly developing his sound.—H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Anz - Unravel In The Designated Zone (OTMI)
> Anz broke out in 2020, but her career has taken off in 2021. Between her yearly all-originals mixes and an increasingly hectic DJing and radio schedule, the Manchester artist knocked out two of the year's most exciting celebrations of UK club music. While her Ninja Tune debut All Hours was a masterclass in fusing pop with electro, UK garage and jungle, "Unravel In The Designated Zone" remains the year's high water mark. It's a bit more understated, but it still feels like an instant classic from the moment the song's lead synth begins howling over her signature off-kilter percussion.—H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / SoundCloud

### SHE Spells Doom - Rudnick (All Centre)
> There was plenty of genre-bending club music released this year, but Zambia-based SHE Spells Doom's release for All Centre was a hybrid like no other. The three-track EP showcased an impressive repertoire, crossing from UK funky to Afro house. But it was the confident swagger of "Rudnick" that kept clocking up the re-listens. The track's synth work has the technicolor polish of contemporary UK techno set over the stuttering swagger of '00s hip-hop percussion. Named for the sci-fi Oedipus anti-hero in the movie Heavy Metal, the track surpasses its namesake, creating a sense of noirish anxiety without losing sight of the funk.—H.I.

### Maara - The Forbidden Plum (Isla)
> 2021 saw a new sound emanating from Canada's dance music underground led by labels like Planet Euphorique, Isla and Acting Press. No one captured this better than Maara and her sexually charged, trance-flecked take on techno and electro. Across two breakout EPs, there was a je ne sais quoi to the Montreal producer's often illicit but lighthearted tracks. Her best song, "The Forbidden Plum" from her Potion Activated EP, had elements of both. Dark, pulsing synth bleeps, a twisted metallic bassline and a prog house throwback gated vocal sit under a repeated refrain: "Want it so badly." "The Forbidden Plum" is a cocktail of hedonistic indulgence.—H.I. Listen: Bandcamp

### SHERELLE - 160 DOWN THE A406 (BEAUTIFUL)
> While SHERELLE expressed plenty of frustration over the pandemic in 2021—and even scolded the UK government in a broadcast for Newsnight—her debut EP was surprisingly light. The A-side, "160 Down The A406," is pure joy, featuring an airy chord progression, dreamy mallet melodies and chipmunk vocal cries all sewn into a breakbeat reverie. Although we can't in good faith recommend doing 160 MPH on the A406, we can put our weight behind this fuzzy footwork-jungle fusion, which showcases how SHERELLE can flex in the box just as much as she can behind the decks.—Emeka Okonkwo Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### MC Boing (Danny L Harle) - Boing Beat (Mad Decent)
> MC Boing is one of the four new aliases Danny L Harle uses on his debut album. With "Boing Beat," he channels early '00s happy hardcore with spellbinding results. As part of the LP's virtual club experience—a four-story rave complex called Harlecore—Harle's tributes border on parody at certain moments. But at others he stumbles upon gold. "Boing Beat" is unapologetic, E'd-up euphoria taken to unnatural highs with MC Boing's manic vocals and Hannah Diamond's girlish, synthetic hook.. While Boing's half-screamed deliveries can be jarring at times, with lyrics as wholesome as "Everyone here is safe and nice / Makes me wanna have a great life," how could we do anything but smile and dance?—E.O. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### LSDXOXO - Sick Bitch (XL Recordings)
> Between those buzzing synth lines and RJ Glasgow's robotic but commanding vocals, "Sick Bitch" by LSDXOXO could easily become this generation's "Satisfaction" by Benny Banassi. The Berlin-based producer and DJ pulled even fewer punches than usual on his XL Recordings debut, opting to go full thrust with lyrics so raunchy they'd leave a conservative news anchor on life support. Talk of testing gag reflexes and exploding in one's own clothes leaves nothing to the imagination and can put every room it's played in in an erotic headlock—or at least a sensual trance.—E.O. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Calibre & DRS v Mark Ernestus - Badder (Signature Records)
> Basic Channel cofounder Mark Ernestus made a relatively rare turn to the mixing console with "Badder," linking up with drum & bass legend Calibre to craft understated and moody dub techno. The song samples the original "Badman," featuring DRS, and subtly riffs on its name. Things get hypnotic as DRS's vocal chops ripple and echo through the mix, while a snare that threatens to land never does. All the while, hi-hats tick ominously like the second hand on a watch. The shadows loom larger in this dark makeover, a bass-heavy maze rife with riveting tension.—E.O. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Fiyahdred - Anyway (Do It) (Hyperdub)
> Press officers will tell you tunes are anthems when they're not. But Hyperdub wasn't messing around with "Anyway (Do It)." This club singalong is a blast of fresh air, blending gqom, amapiano and UK funky with an insanely catchy vocal about rolling spliffs and generally not giving a fuck. There's nothing more exciting than a new artist breaking through with absolute fire. On the strength of this banger and the rest of their excellent debut EP, 2022 could be a life-changing year for the burgeoning UK producer.—Carlos Hawthorn Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Jossy Mitsu - Ø (Astral Black)
> Two wins stand out for Jossy Mitsu in 2021: becoming a resident at London club fabric and releasing her debut EP, Planet J. The impressive thing about her productions is how they echo her DJ sets, distilling a love of dubstep, UK garage, techno and jungle into a fresh, convincing package. The pick of the bunch was "Ø," named after Hyperdub's groundbreaking London party. The track's title informed its contents: dark, slinky and dripping in wall-rattling UK energy.—C.H. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

## [The Best Albums of 2021](https://ra.co/features/3950)
Date: 2021-12-15T21:27:34.000Z

### Space Afrika - Honest Labour (Dais Records)
> Listening to Honest Labour feels like street lights burning onto tired retinas and long nights of feeling small in a big city. On their sophomore album, producers Joshua Inyang and Joshua Reid created a series of nocturnal meditations, a series of nineteen short tracks bleeding into one another, in tribute to their hometown of Manchester. The duo's instrumentation is replete with field recordings of urban white noise, balanced by resonant cellos, hazy guitars and spectral guest performances with fragments of profound conversations—as if overheard from the night before—resulting in the audio equivalent of subconscious dreamscape. Put simply by Inyang and Reid themselves, Honest Labour is "an album about love and loss." The track "Indigo Grit," for instance, abruptly ends just as the speaker is about to explain the difference between liking and loving someone—a fleeting snippet of wisdom lost just before listeners could grab hold of it. But as with any inquiries into life’s most existential questions, the artists weren't intending to arrive at any conclusions. Through their album, they embraced the sheer mystery of the human experience, remaining at the mercy of their emotions just like the rest of us.—Emeka Okonkwo Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### AceMoMA - A Future (Haus of Altr)
> AceMo and MoMA Ready have released a gob-stopping amount of music over the past few years, but their second album together, A Future, really put it all into perspective. The duo work in a well-worn transatlantic tradition, blending drum & bass, jungle and techno, but in their hands it feels cutting-edge as they jump from one tempo to the next with tangible excitement. In spite of its name, the album is the sound of the duo creating a better present, of reimagining Afrofuturist narratives to suit the here-and-now rather than a distant future, of AceMoMA paving the way for everyone around them in New York and beyond.—Andrew Ryce Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Eris Drew - Quivering In Time (T4T LUV NRG)
> After conquering the DJing circuit with a mix of psychedelic evangelism and irresistible old-school techno flair, Eris Drew started dipping her toes into production with vibrant results. On her debut album, Quivering In Time, she outdoes herself with nine tracks of club heat packing a festival-sized dose of euphoria into a retro sound palette of tight drum loops, breakbeats and dewy pads. She even includes a sample of psychonaut and ethnobotanist Terence McKenna to drive the point home. House music in 2021 hardly got much more ecstatic than this.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Emeka Ogboh - Beyond The Yellow Haze (A-TON)
> Is Beyond The Yellow Haze pretty funky for an art installation? Quite possibly. The original piece catalogs the sounds of bustling Lagos—car horns, traffic, chatter. Those recordings, made into an album for A-TON—Ostgut Ton’s art-forward sublabel—forms the foundation for ghostly broken techno that moves with the start-stop pulse of everyday life in the city. Ogboh's rich, layered atmospherics approximate fog and the motion blur of brake lights on a busy freeway, capturing the vibe of a city in the midst of immense growth, like a moment encased in amber.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Erika de Casier - Sensational (4AD)
> It's difficult to think of any other record this year that united more people from across different electronic music scenes than Sensational. Building on the Danish artist's Y2K R&B obsession and backed with lush yet subdued production from collaborator Central, it is a quiet storm of plucked strings, ornate piano and pitter-patter drums. De Casier's hushed voice alternates between vulnerable and sarcastic, full of biting phrases and memorable one-liners: "You gotta be polite if you wanna roll with me." It’s the kind of music that's made for both memorable dance floor moments and cryptic Instagram captions directed at you-know-who.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### George Riley - interest rates, a tape (Self-released)
> It's tempting to call George Riley an old soul given her use of R&B vocals over '90s-influenced jazzy breaks, but that wouldn't do justice to her first mixtape, which felt ambitious even at its most relaxed. Her words come out in a stream-of-consciousness blur, revealing and incisive in their casual, say-whatever-comes-to mind-flow ("I don't want any man / Full stop!"). Oliver Palfreyman's beats feel dynamic and fluid, as if tailored to every twist and turn in Riley's sinuous vocal melodies. Dark, uplifting and sometimes even funny, it is one of the most striking R&B debuts of the year—Afrofuturism tuned to a very personal frequency.—A.R. Listen: Spotify / Apple Music

### Hoavi - Invariant (Peak Oil)
> With Invariant, Hoavi set a new standard for what you might call ambient jungle. Combining the luxe atmospherics of dub techno, the fidgety pulse of footwork and the acrobatic loop-de-loops of jungle, the Russian producer's album is uncommonly beautiful, blowing minds while soothing them at the same time. You can pick any track at random and find something to obsess over—the breakcore-in-the-clouds of "Dver," the Balearic funk of "Streamline." But the LP is best taken as a whole, a wash of creamy chords and aerodynamic drum programming.—A.R. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Virtual Dreams: Ambient Explorations In The House & Techno Age, 1993-1997 (MUSIC FROM MEMORY)
> Landing at the very end of 2020, when so many of us were deep in another round of lockdowns, Music From Memory's Virtual Dreams compilation was practically made for daydreaming in your bedroom. Bringing together some of the finest downtempo cuts from both lesser-known names like MDA Analog and lesser-known projects from established names (like Move D and Roman Flügel), the compilation creates a half-lidded world where kick drums dreamily float in and out of focus. Virtual Dreams maps a time when the boundaries between electronic music for the club and the living room weren’t totally solidified, occupying a corridor space between the chill-out room and the dance floor. —Henry Ivry. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Various - The Sound Of Limo (Limousine Dream)
> Gene On Earth's The Sound of Limo compilation is a roster of the artists du jour of the new minimal scene, providing documentary evidence of a vital corner of the underground while also working surprisingly well as a cohesive album. Each producer gathered here, from Sugar Free to Dyed Soundorom, has their own quirks, but certain throughlines—chunky basslines, swung drums, cascading video game bleeps—define a sub-genre of a sub-genre unto themselves. The music here is club-ready tech house, but the flourishes of fluorescent synth and often wacky melodies make it as whimsical as it is functional.—H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Soundcloud

### Skee Mask - Pool (Ilian Tape)
> Clocking in at over an hour and 45 minutes, Pool demanded a commitment to active listening when it dropped. But Skee Mask has always excelled in the album format, and the extended run time allowed him to cover more ground than ever before. Pool takes the plunge into the sui generis cannabis haze of its soundscapes, where Skee Mask put his love of ambient atmosphere and UK dance music into conversation with bits of soulful funk, jazz and some of his fastest tempos yet (Pool went north of the 170 Arctic Circle at points). But, as only Skee Mask can, he creates an immersive and singular trip where genres come second to the textural richness and detail of his soundscapes, which range from danceable to stop-you-in-your-tracks gorgeous—H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / SoundCloud

### Yu Su - Yellow River Blue (bié RECORDS)
> Yu Su's steady stream of dance-adjacent 12-inches over the past four years established a dusky and increasingly ornate twist on the Vancouver house sound, but her debut album Yellow River Blue took her somewhere entirely new, both figuratively and literally. The album functions both as a travel diary and love song. It documents a tour through her native China from Qingdao to the far-west city of Xining, recorded in different cities across the country where Yu Su both reconnected with her homeland and found a whole new community of electronic producers she was previously cut off from. The album is appropriately restless and exploratory, as Yu Su charts a path through geography and genres, from slo-mo breakbeat to Krautrock to dubby downtempo. —H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Perila - How Much Time It Is Between You And Me? (Smalltown Supersound)
> Aleksandra Zakharenko, alongside similar-minded artists like Ulla and Ben Bondy, makes ambient music that breaks the mold: it's not necessarily intended to bring you solace and definitely won't make an easy soundtrack for any hotel lobbies (or elevators). How Much Time It Is Between You And Me?, is just as unsettling and eerie as it is delicate. The album uses these mixed emotions—as well as touches of post-rock melodrama and angst—to create a liminal state between waking and dreaming held together by Zakharenko's voice, which guides you through labyrinths that can be nightmarish but, just as quickly, morph into luxurious daydreams. —H.I. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Andy Stott - Never The Right Time (Modern Love)
> It's been a decade since Andy Stott released the pair of EPs that introduced us to the dubby world of "knackered house." Since then, the UK artist's music has incorporated decaying memories of pop, like a ghostly outline caught in a photograph, through his ongoing collaborations with Alison Skidmore. Never The Right Time polished that rusting patina into Stott's most accessible album to date. "Don't Know How" is, by his standards, nearly bubblegum. This was true across the board on the record—even the abrasive mechanical rain of "Answers" ends with an uplifting, choral melody. Stott hasn’t lost his penchant for darkness, but now he isn’t afraid of contrasting it with bold and bright bursts of colour either.—H.I. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / SoundCloud

### Wanton Witch - Wanton Witch (Stroboscopic Artefacts)
> Stroboscopic Artefacts has been a hub for no-frills experimental techno for more than a decade, modeling itself in the restrained but psychedelic-friendly image of label owner Lucy. Following a year-long hiatus in 2020—after Lucy released a ten-year compilation of sleek dance floor cuts by mostly old guard artists—the label returned with the surprising self-titled LP from Bangkok-based Wanton Witch. The album opens a new chapter for Stroboscopic Artefacts, not only by featuring a queer, trans outsider artist, but by presenting a volatile, rave-adjacent sound palette beyond the label's wheelhouse. Wanton Witch dive-bombes and detonates with apocalyptic thuds and hardstyle drum fills, marking a new and exciting turn for the imprint and for Alegria's blossoming career. —Chloe Lula Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Dawn Richard - Second Line (Merge Records)
> Dawn Richard's sixth album—and first for the indie giant Merge—introduces her Afrofuturist alter ego, the golden, feather-plumed cyborg King Creole, who Richard described as an "assassination of stereotypes." Working Black-rooted genres like bounce and footwork into her usual experimental R&B, Richard balances a sense of play with her core strengths as a vocalist. "Bussifame" explodes with rallying whoops and commanding swagger, "Jacuzzi" aches with crooning sensuality, and "FiveOhFour (a lude)" switches to a braggadocious snarl. In tandem with intimate audio clips of her mother’s musings on love and Louisiana, it is a kaleidoscopic portrait of Richard's inner world and Southern heritage in glossy, florid detail. —Whitney Wei Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### L'Rain - Fatigue (Mexican Summer)
> L'Rain's second album meditates on the seismic complexities of a single emotion—grief—and its ability to exhaust and to destabilize, but to also spur personal evolution. Fatigue swoons into a tender revelry, both in terms of L'Rain's purring vocals and her warm, glowing productions, where the jangling piano keys and melancholic punctuation of saxophone dance around grainy sound recordings. It reminds listeners that sadness is so often site-specific. As a born-and-raised Brooklyner, L'Rain's singular blend of jazz, neo soul and ambient bears the heaviness of her urban environs on top of an already bruised psyche. —W.W. Listen: Bandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music / Soundcloud

### V/A - Amapiano Now (NTS)
> If anything's apparent from the past few years, it's that dance music is inherently political. The most exciting dance music genre in the world at the moment—amapiano—demonstrates this point in a strikingly literal manner. Born in the townships in Gauteng, South Africa, the fledgling post-kwaito genre is the sound of joy in the midst of struggle. Now it's sweeping the globe. Amapiano Now, the 16-track compilation from NTS, is a bluffer's guide to the new South African dance phenomenon. From established acts like Vigro Deep and Gaba Canal to upstarts like Teno Afrika, the Shannen SP and Joe Cotch-curated collection demonstrates the inherent mid-tempo sensuality of amapiano, the thrilling sound of a generation of artists discovering their powerful collective voice. —Matt McDermott Listen: Spotify / Soundcloud

### Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders & The London Symphony Orchestra - Promises (Luaka Bop)
> Reading over the personnel for Promises, one might expect a grandiose statement—a multigenerational spiritual jazz odyssey for the ages. Instead, Sam Shepherd and the legendary Pharoah Sanders show a staggering knack for subtlety. Building upon a searching motif of four seven-note chords, both Shepherd and Sanders play with extraordinary humility. The careful arrangements serve as a backdrop for Sanders' restrained sax soloing, but the record doesn’t headline one artist over the other. Instead it reaches for an ineffable oneness, the pinnacle of improvised exploration. Each gradual change feels monumental, like the spaced-out synth exploration on "Movement 7" or the Hammond organ passed through a vibrating Leslie speaker on "Movement 8." That Promises holds its own—and even stands out—within one of the most important catalogues in jazz is a remarkable achievement. —M.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### DJ Manny - Signals In My Head (Planet Mu)
> 2021 was a golden year for footwork. This year, Planet Mu, once responsible for thrusting the Chicago genre onto the international stage in the mid-'10s, put out a trilogy of releases from stalwarts of this syncopated world: Jana Rush, RP Boo and DJ Manny. On Manny's contribution, the veteran Chicago-born, Brooklyn-based artist sought to bring romance to a genre historically known for soundtracking dance battles. If anyone could step up to this challenge, it would be DJ Manny and his smooth production style. Signals In My Head sees him whipping up some of the most airy atmospheres footwork has ever seen. Rosy melodies swirl into delirium while R&B vocals coo, sometimes lustfully and other times longingly, mellowing out its characteristically rougher rhythms and leaving only traces of a harder past.—Kiana Mickles Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Dean Blunt - Black Metal 2 (Rough Trade)
> Dean Blunt has long been an elusive character, quietly releasing oblique albums without liner notes and responding to interview questions in riddles. His entire body of work could be viewed like a museum of intriguing abstract paintings, open to interpretation but always astonishing. His most recent record riffs on its predecessor's Americana themes—heart-tugging strings, whining harmonica, desert rock guitar and somber and occasionally tongue-in-cheek lyrics that allude to loss, betrayal and the white critic's flimsy observations. But with the help of Joanne Robertson's girlish voice, as if brought down straight from heaven, Black Metal 2 emerges as one of Blunt's most approachable records. —K.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Tirzah - Colourgrade (Domino)
> If Tirzah's breakout debut album Devotion was beloved for its intimate romantic love songs, the tracks on Colourgrade will be remembered for expanding the definition of what constitutes a love song in the first place. Moving out of the city and giving birth to two children, Tirzah examined other forms of love, like the camaraderie between creative partners or the bond between parent and child. Some tracks here make it difficult to parse whether she is referring to a lover, a relative or an old childhood friend, but the universality of it all makes Colourgrade a record that will age gracefully with repeated listens. Adding to its introspective beauty and warmth, the album is brought to life with grainy production and endearing imperfections (a cough here, incomprehensible whispers there). Charmingly unpolished and grounded in a human need we can all agree on—love—it's an album that encourages listeners to cherish life's smallest, most precious moments. —K.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### HTRK - Rhinestones (N & J Blueberries)
> People rarely talk about their favourite "band" anymore. HTRK, the Australian duo comprising Jonnine Standish and Nigel Yang, are one of a handful of groups that inspire this level of dedication in their fans. Their music holds similar qualities to other classic "favourite bands," like The Cure—their songs microcosms of ineffable longing and desolation. On their latest LP Rhinestones, HTRK continue to embrace stripped-down guitars, this time going for a twang and effects palette that evokes the Kodachrome skies of Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas. In the film, the sprawling vistas and stark photography set the stage for a hushed, heartbreaking drama. Here, the sparse guitar and unhurried progressions serve a similar purpose, foregrounding Standish's languid vocals. As usual, deceptively simple lines like"If you wanted to / Hang out with mе during the day," on "Sunlight Feels Like Bee Stings," hit like a brick. —M.M. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Joy Orbison - still slipping vol. 1 (XL Recordings)
> Long gone is the Joy Orbison who only makes club bangers. In his place sits a producer whose music is, with every new release, a truer, more vivid expression of not only his ever-broader tastes, but also his life and loves. Building on recent experiments with R&B and downtempo music, still slipping vol. 1 incorporates voice notes from his family—asking Joy how he's doing, making jokes, talking about weed brownies—into a cosy world of tunes that range from sedate garage to hooky, subdued pop. It feels like a Sunday afternoon in Joy's living room: vinyl all over the floor, loved ones popping in and out and talented friends occasionally jumping on the mic, all culminating into a more relaxed look at one of UK dance music's most quietly virtuosic producers.—Carlos Hawthorn Listen: Bandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music

### Mr. Mitch - Lazy (Gobstopper Records)
> It can take artists years—decades, even—to be able to authentically express themselves through their music. Mr. Mitch said this personal change occurred around the release of his 2017 album, Devout, a vulnerable record inspired by fatherhood. Not coincidentally, it was also the first time his fans had truly embraced his experimentations with slower tempos, ornate instrumentation and song-oriented structures. The Londoner built on this newfound freedom and confidence on this year's Lazy, with 11 tracks packing a range of energies and emotions. There are heart-rending tributes to his own musician father and strong statements about racism and social justice (the title is a reference to stereotypes about Black people), blending not only genres but personal and political messages in a way that could have felt forced and overblown in less accomplished hands. Instead, one feels profoundly moved. —C.H. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Loraine James - Reflection (Hyperdub)
> The late and great Mark Fisher feared that musical ingenuity was being replaced by desperate revivalism in the dying embers of late capitalism. If he was around now, Reflection might soothe those fears. James' mesmerising neo-IDM classic gestures towards dance music or bedroom R&B, only to take sudden detours into terra incognito that eludes categorisation altogether. (Nothing feels more appropriate than the outro being titled "We're Building Something New.") Sludgy, off-kilter kicks thud under pensive chords like some alien life form's interpretation of dance music. At times heartbreaking, at others startlingly vulnerable, James contemplates pandemic-era existentialism, projecting anxieties about the future with a ghostly delivery that feels like inner monologues being broadcast for all to hear: "This is a reflection / Just mine, not yours." —E.O Listen: Bandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music / Soundcloud

### Arushi Jain - Under The Lilac Sky (Leaving Records)
> Arushi Jain has a buzzy, larger-than-life personality, but you'd hardly know that from her restrained and gentle music. Constantly jumping from project to project, Jain always found solace in Indian classical compositions when feeling overwhelmed, and wanted her own work to channel the same healing qualities. On her second full-length, she captures the evening light in all its ever-changing glory, moving from sunset to darkness. Humming synths and drones conjure the flickering shadows of twilight, while her voice adds bursts of vivid colour. Aimed at instilling a certain kind of intentionality and meditation in its listeners, Under The Lilac Sky is a guaranteed palette cleanser for those seeking clarity or simply enjoying an evening wind-down.—Nyshka Chandran Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Conclave - Conclave (Love Injection)
> The self-titled debut from New York ensemble Conclave is a masterful study in rhythmic flexibility. True to their jazz roots, the group of rotating musicians—led by DJ and multi-instrumentalist Cesar Toribio—start the record as improvisational jams before narrowing down a vision and a concept. Their live approach is tangible: several tracks start on simple refrains before morphing into full-bodied flurries of dreamy funk, Afro-Latin percussion and downtempo beats. In homage to the clave (an instrument and rhythmic pattern), Toribio and his players concoct a joyous commemoration of the power of collaboration, unity and the cathartic energy of house music itself.—N.C. Listen: Bandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music / Soundcloud

### Nala Sinephro - Space 1.8 (Warp Records)
> On her Warp Records debut, London-based harpist and modular synthesist Nala Sinephro creates introspective electronic soundscapes with warm exhortations from the UK jazz new guard (musicians like Nubya Garcia and Eddie Hick). Combining ambient music and spiritual jazz, Space 1.8 lands like a caress, owing to Sinephro's intuitive touch—she knows exactly when to press, linger or just hold still. "While my hands are doing their job, I’m almost sleepwalking," she told The Guardian in a recent interview. Ranging from meditative to pulsating—with an incredible, career-making 17-minute finale—Sinephro's ambitious but effortless compositions comfort and soothe in all the right places. —N.C. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

## [2020's Best Albums](https://ra.co/features/3787)
Date: 2020-12-23T12:00:59.000Z

### Various HOA 10-12 Haus Of ALTR 
> 2020's busiest electronic artist might have been Wyatt D. Stevens, AKA MoMa Ready. Beyond the dozen or so records he produced himself (including an LP with AceMo and two solo albums), there were the ten he released on his label, HAUS Of ALTR, three of which were towering achievements in themselves: HOA 10, 11 and 12, compilations of more than 25 tracks each, released in June, July and September, each of them presenting, in their own words, "the future of Black electronic music," the "Vangaurd in the war against white supremacy in electronic music," and a "march toward a future of unabashed Black electronic expression." These 72 tracks show dozens of vital artists from New York and beyond delivering their A-game or something close to it. Together, they form an embarrassment of riches we're still getting through half a year later. Listen: Bandcamp HOA010 / HOA011 / HOA12

### Slikback /// + ///II Self-Released 
> On September 1st, Slikback released ///, a surprise album that, at 30 tracks, doubled the size of the Nairobi artist's catalog in one fell swoop. Three days later, he released another 30-track bundle, ///||. He called them "a reflection of different vibes and emotions that make me... some rough, some gentle, some funny." The energy and artistry of these 60 tracks is stunning. Gqom, trap, noise, ambient, drill, footwork and techno all get tossed into Slikback's musical wood-chipper. Tempos run from around 70 BPM to over 170. Guest appearances range from Polish sound artist Morgiana Hz to the Ugandan MC Swordman Kitala. These albums should not be an easy listen—they clang, groan, shriek and bang, and sneak up on you when you least expect it. But instead of wearing you down, each new track lures you further in. You never know what kind of perfectly sideways groove is lurking around the corner. Listen: Bandcamp /// / Bandcamp /​/​/ II

### KMRU Peel + opaquer Editions Mego + Dagoretti Records 
> It's fitting that 2020 would produce a breakout star from the realms of ambient and field recording. Kenyan artist Joseph Kamaru, AKA KMRU, had been bubbling up already, but in 2020 he seemed to be everywhere, dropping tracks on his Bandcamp, appearing on the excellent Physically Sick 3, and releasing these two stunning LPs (along with a cassette, Jar) that show the incredible breadth of his sound. Appearing on esteemed avant-garde outlet Editions Mego, Peel is a silky abyss of droning soundscapes and spectral field recordings. Opaquer is its adventurous counterpart, with tracks like "Lost Ones" and "Canthenta" having more in common with bass-heavy experimental music than anything you'd typically call ambient. Together, they introduced many of us to an artist whose music is as powerful as it is subtle. Peel: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify opaquer: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Ulla Tumbling Towards A Wall Experiences Ltd 
> It doesn't lull you into a vegitative state, nor evoke a hotel spa lobby via rainforest field recordings. Instead, the side of ambient Ulla conjures on tumbling towards a wall carries you away with the subtlety of a daydream. The Kansas City artist has worn many aesthetic hats over the years, both on previous releases like Append and in projects like Pontiac Streator and the newly minted LOG. Her delicate compositional ear is clearer than ever on this release. Tracks like "stunned suddenly" and "new poem'' create space to think, without trying too hard to relax you. "feeling remembering," "leaves and wish" and "soak" are spotted with melodies and gentle textures—the album is ripe with soothing sounds, but never cluttered with them. You walk away from tumbling towards a wall feeling like the artist has told you something personal, a secret, and a precious one at that, even if you can't say exactly what it is. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### E.M.M.A. Indigo Dream Local Action 
> In the seven years since her debut album, E.M.M.A. has gotten comfortable composing soundtracks and scores—her recent work has found her soundtracking campaigns for luxury fashion houses like Gucci and Chanel. Her affinity towards large-scale, cinematic projects is reflected in the brief 35 minutes that make up Indigo Dream. Swirling '80s synths and club sounds collide on this mesmerizing album, sending us to the zenith of yearnful nostalgia and back again. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Theo Parrish Wuddaji Sound Signature 
> Even within Theo Parrish's catalogue, Wuddaji felt like a monumental entry. After innovating an often-imitated, never-replicated brand of deep house around the turn of the millennium, Wuddaji's eight tracks felt like a new milestone, or a jumping off point for some new, deliriously funky Black dance music. Dense, futuristic tunes like "Hennyweed Buckdance" are interspersed with floor-fillers like "Angry Purple Birds" and "This is For You." Wuddaji came with a map of Idlewild, a once-thriving vacation enclave in Northwestern Michigan that saw the likes of Aretha Franklin and Louis Armstrong performing for Black audiences escaping segregation in St. Louis and Detroit. Wuddaji, like so much of his music, draws from the personal and the historical, musical and otherwise. His deep understanding of the triumphs and injustices of the past—and their impact on the present—is raw material for groundbreaking art. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud / Sound Signature

### BOOF Rebirth Of Gerberdaisy Bubble Tease Communications 
> Maurice Fulton has a lighthearted, often humorous approach to dance music, and it's safe to say that BOOF is his quirkiest project. These records come out once every five years or so, are always named after flowers and feature elementary artwork that looks like it was made in Microsoft Paint (a stretched flower and clashing text). But beneath that exterior is some of the best work the American multi-instrumentalist has ever put out. Rebirth Of Gerberdaisy is no exception. In fact, it's the best BOOF record yet, with the gusto of a talented live band trying to work out as many dance genres as they can: minimal techno, piano house, stomping disco, jazz fusion and deep, soulful grooves. Of course it's not a band you're hearing, just Fulton going crazy on the organ, guitar and keyboards, a one-of-a-kind talent that makes every genre sound like something he invented.

### Beatrice Dillon Workaround PAN 
> The idea of the lone genius is appealing, but most great records are the labor of many minds. On Workaround, South London-born artist Beatrice Dillon embraces the collectivity of music-making, weaving together acoustic instrumentation from 12 different collaborators with her software production techniques to create 14 rhythmically complex toe-tappers, all fixed at 150 BPM. Batu brings the hi-hats on "Workaround Six," which are nonchalantly assembled into a beat, while the malevolent thwack of stand-up bass comes courtesy of Swedish jazz musician Petter Eldh. "Workaround Two" has flushed synths and vocals from Laurel Halo. Dillon's catalogue is an advent calendar of distinct treats, containing dub techno abstractions such as 2015's Face A, experimental cassettes like Index Tape For Performance and Two Changes (with Rupert Clervaux). Workaround, galvanized by a crush on UK dance music, is cultivated through the diligent practice of purposeful limitation. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Various Physically Sick 3 Allergy Season 
> At the beginning of July, four months into the pandemic and six weeks into daily protests following the murder of George Floyd by police, Allergy Season and Discwoman dropped Physically Sick 3, a charity compilation that raised money for Equality For Flatbush, an organization fighting police brutality and gentrification that also helped residents of Brooklyn stay safe during COVID-19. Curated by Physical Therapy, Umfang and Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson, the music was exceptional—27 tracks of bold club sounds, plus the odd bit of noise and ambient, from a cast of artists that spanned continents and generations. The series' tradition of what it once called "electronic protest music" had never felt more necessary, and it was inspiring to see electronic artists rising to the occasion so readily. Beyond being some of the best music that came out this year, Physically Sick 3 was a how-to in DIY music activism. Listen: Bandcamp

### Ana Roxanne Because Of A Flower Kranky 
> Ana Roxanne's debut record, ~~~, had ambient fans in the palm of her hand, eagerly awaiting a follow-up. Her sound instantly had its own niche, drawing from New Age, devotional music and drone. Because Of A Flower is a more confident record than her first. It's conceptually provoking and brilliantly executed, full of vulnerability and understated beauty. Her enchanting vocals elevate Because Of A Flower above your typical ambient fare. It's a refined set of songs that seem to fly by and leave you in a different, more serene mood from where you started. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Jonnine Blue Hills Boomkat Editions 
> Many of the most cherished post-punk pop records—Young Marble Giants' Colossal Youth, Gareth Williams & Mary Currie's Flaming Tunes—are scrappy projects held together by spit and glue. Jonnine's Blue Hills fits that bill. Recorded at HTRK member Jonnine Standish's home in the Dandenong Ranges outside Melbourne, the nine-track album was a low-key affair, first released on cassette as part of Boomkat's series of quarantine records, Documenting Sound. But the spare songs, built on less-is-more bass lines and Standish's spectral vocals, punched above their weight with their effortless mix of the mundane and the sublime. "And hey, you're the best thing that I've had / because you want all the things that I have / And when the birds sing / they sing just for you / they live in blue hills," Standish sang, guiding the listener through the small psychodramas of a life lived in lockdown at the edge of the forest. Listen: Boomkat

### Moodymann Taken Away KDJ 
> Maybe you saw Moodymann in the flesh this year. Or caught his residency at Grand Theft Auto's new nightclub, The Music Locker. Most of us weren't so lucky. Instead, we sought consolation in Taken Away, a record so quintessentially Kenny Dixon Jr. it could probably form the basis of a biography. Detroit? Tick. Roller skating? Tick. Track after track of toasty gospel, house and hip-hop, peppered with sultry, sometimes madcap musings from the "most memorable voice in modern dance music"? Obviously. This LP had it all. Behold a masterclass in house music songwriting. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Yves Tumor Heaven To A Tortured Mind Warp Records 
> The highlight of Yves Tumor's show-stopping fourth album is "Kerosene," a collaboration with the singer Diana Gordon that isn't so much a duet as a collision, rising to a churning climax where Gordon's vocals feel like a cross between Dolores O'Riordan and Alanis Morrisette. It's a moment of fireworks on an album that functions like a powder keg, a 21st-century rock opera starring Tumor, flanked by an arsenal of session musicians and armed with oodles of vaporwave-style loops. Here, amid horn sections that rise up like tidal waves and guitar leads that go up against clipped funk samples, Yves Tumor emerges as something like the rock star they've tried to be for years: sexy, alien, suave, and a master of melodies that get stuck in your head. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Shinichi Atobe Yes DDS 
> No one knows much about techno producer Shinichi Atobe. The Saitama-based artist has been releasing albums on DDS for five years now, with the only communication between him and the label typically consisting of no more than a CD with track titles in the mail. Building on the warm housey elements that were the foundation's of 2018's Heat, Yes is chock full of bright melodies, and of course delivered with his trademark hi-fi production standard. There are also a few surprises, too, like the sci-fi synths on "Lake 3," the funk-driven pulse of "Ocean 1" and the Drexciyan touch of "Loop 1." Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Actress Karma & Desire Ninja Tune 
> There's always excitement around an Actress album, but for this year's Karma & Desire, Darren Cunningham and Ninja Tune went the extra mile. There was a prequel mixtape, which included a cryptic teaser tracklist for the album proper. There was a short film and a hotline you could call to hear a track down the phone. For a few days, rumours even spread of a second Actress mixtape, but it turned out to be the work of Dam Voyage. After all that, Karma & Desire had to be good. Cunningham delivered on the build-up and then some. What we got was a more open and fun version of Actress's early sound. The vocalists made the record more accessible. The instrumentals, too, were brighter and clearer. The album experience, its innovative preamble included, was a clear highlight of 2020. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Duval Timothy Help Carrying Colour 
> Duval Timothy's fourth album has a documentary writer's touch. With his piano front-and-center, the LP narrates a journey of healing and navigating the perils of the music industry, primarily drawing on minimalist jazz hooks and immersive sampling. Timothy has a gift for making gems out of the mundane. On Help, spare vocals are distorted and looped into oddball rhythms, while field recordings bring the compositions to life. It's one of those special, emotive albums that says a lot by doing less. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Yaeji What We Drew 우리가 그려왔던 XL Recordings 
> After creating dance floor bangers so universal they had festival crowds sing along with them, Yaeji took a backseat, preferring to collaborate and curate rather than release the long-awaited follow-up to her breakthrough EPs. What We Drew is a candid study of depression and ennui, how to break free from those things, and how to avoid beating yourself up when you do feel bad. The lead single is a tribute to the act of living: "I got hydrating down / I got listening down," she sings. On "Money Can't Buy," her guest Nappy Nina says, "Snuggly and sleepy / These naps come easy" after a verse of braggadoccio. What We Drew makes it clear that Yaeji connects with audiences around the world because she presents life as it is, celebrating the triumph of persevering and just getting the small things down, supported by love not only from others, but for yourself, too. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Jasmine Infiniti BXTCH SLÄP Self-released 
> More than most techno producers, Jasmine Infiniti embodies the euphoric potential of the genre alongside its darker impulses. Take "Downhill," where muddy drums thump beneath bright, neon-streaked synths. The American artist's debut album straddles this divide so well because of Jasmine Infiniti's lived experience as a person on the margins, where nightlife can be a trap as much as an escape. But for every moment of foreboding, there's a glimpse of light, underpinned by an elastic, almost buoyant sense of melody and rhythm, informed by her days in the Bay Area's vogue scene and the taut slap of ballroom music. It's a techno record unlike any other in 2020—heavy and light, ecstatic and paranoid. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Headie One Edna Relentless Records 
> The authorities coming down hard on Black music is nothing new, but the story around UK drill felt different. This time, even hugely influential platforms like YouTube shared in the vilification, removing videos at the request of the police. That was in 2018, which is incredible when you consider how far the genre has come since then. No one better embodies this turnaround than poster boy Headie One, whose excellent debut album, Edna, felt like a watershed moment for UK drill. Here was a #1 record laying bare the glory and despair of gang life in London, told through the eyes of not only its protagonist but a whole cast of rap stars, from local legends (M Huncho, Ivorian Doll) to global icons (Drake). Once again, Black street music, through a combination of grit and pure talent, had silenced its critics and conquered the mainstream. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

## [2020's Best Mixes](https://ra.co/features/3789)
Date: 2020-12-21T12:00:53.000Z

### Anz 
> Anz spring/summer dubs 2020 Anz's fifth production mix, spring/summer dubs 2020, was "built through turbulence and forged in feeling," yet somehow the tracks are fizzing with euphoria. Taken from an arsenal of a whopping 74 tracks made during quarantine, the UK producer compiled 84 minutes of summery UK dance music into this mix, which fans out over UK funky, 2-step garage, dubstep and jungle. The edit samples range from '90s hip-hop and R&B to the TikTok favorite "Renegade," which is remixed with raucous amen breaks. Conducta The Kiwi Sound Two years, two unbelievably good mixes from Conducta. The Kiwi Sound, the follow-up to 2019's #1 pick, hits many of the same notes: bouncy, bright and stacked with the best in fresh UK garage. It's a bold statement on the health of the modern scene, which has taken years to break through despite UK garage never really going away. Finally, everyone's favourite summer sound is back where it belongs: in the hands of young, talented tastemakers with the world at their feet. FAUZIA DISCWOMAN 87 "Almost didn't do this as I didn't think it was good enough," FAUZIA says of her DISCWOMAN mix, "but my friends forced me to see it through!" The idea of this all-originals mix not being good enough becomes almost impossible to conceive about halfway through, when she's blasted her way through Plaid-style IDM, throbbing deep house and stonking dubstep. The mix seems to catch the artist just as she's found her voice, like a bolt of lightning captured in a photograph. As tracks from it have trickled out on various releases through the year, FAUZIA's star has only grown brighter. This mix, frozen in time, is basically where it all started. Scott Zacharias & Patrick Russell IT.podcast.s09e05 & IT.podcast.s09e01 For a small but dedicated group within rave culture, it goes without saying that No Way Back, arguably the last vestige of the hallowed Midwest rave tradition, is the biggest event, of any kind, on the calendar all year. These two sets from this year's streamed edition show what's unique about the party, from the range of records played, to the peerless taste and panache of their selectors. Patrick Russell's set embodies No Way Back's bread and butter: leftfield techno and electro gems, drawn from decades of dedicated digging, perfectly arranged into a mind-bending slipstream of sound. Scott Zacharias, who usually plays the chillout room ("Outer Space") at sunrise, is the party's dessert, bringing a psychedelic soup of jazz, rock, dub, hip-hop, ambient, Italo, funk, soul and whatever else fits a sound he likes to call "sleaze." Together, these sets demonstrate the limitless possibilities not just of No Way Back, but of playing records in general. Job Jobse Sunrise at the last ever Nachtdigital All 140 minutes of this glorious mix encapsulate why we’ve been missing clubbing so much in 2020. It has everything: pop hits, rave classics, the hiss of the Nachtdigital crowd cavorting in the dawn sun. Early on, the heavens opened, followed by hours of unabated sunshine. Friends frollicked in the lake, partners kissed and embraced, and Job Jobse, the master of ceremonies, surveyed the sandy dance floor with the grin of a man whose dreams had come true. Listening to this mix brings it all flooding back. Juliana Huxtable Dekmantel 288 To take a line from one of her own poems, Juliana Huxtable’s Dekmantel Podcast contains a "PALPABLY HIGH LEVEL OF IDGAF ENERGY." The Texas-born artist is impatient behind the decks, knocking through visceral techno, vocal samples and industrial interventions with marvelous fluidity, compounding them into a hypnotizing sound collage that advances towards evermore stimulating sonic extremes. Change is a constant in this mix, and no genre is out of bounds. The permissive approach means it's packed with potential peak moments, poised and ready to encite euphoria for a range of listeners, whatever their niche. Nicolas Lutz at Phonoteque Nicolas Lutz has long been the maestro of playing records for which you'd happily trade a limb in return for an ID. Thanks to him and peers like Binh and DJ Masda, overlooked corners of house, techno, electro, trance and breakbeat history are now prime influences for a burgeoning audience of DJs and producers, many of whom might not have formerly paid mind to the so-called "minimal" scene from which those DJs emerged. This mix from Phonotheque—home base for Lutz, DJ Koolt and the rest of the Montevideo techno scene—shows things are coming full circle. More than ever, Lutz is playing new music that his sound has directly influenced. He's also reaching for records that fit into his taste bracket but come from sources you might not expect. It would've been unusual a few years ago that he'd play something by, say, Overmono. It speaks to how different parts of dance music are coming ever closer into orbit. Theo Parrish We Are All Gorgeous Monsterss Theo Parrish's We Are All Georgeous Monsterss is more than a DJ mix: it's a casually delivered manifesto. In the fever pitch of the largest protest movement in US history, Parrish uploaded, revised and eventually pulled down an expansive six-part set that drew direct connections between racial violence and the appropriation of electronic dance music from its Black roots. "You don't know what this music means to us, you only know what it means to you," Parrish intoned. "Now granted, you take your ideas, you run with it, you create your own shit, that's great, you create your own universe of it. Please, go right ahead, there's nothing wrong with being inspired, but my god, you can't have all of it!" Quotes and archival interviews break up Parrish's own spoken word as he unfurls hours of unreleased material, spanning from melancholy jazz piano to frenetic beat tracks. All the while, the Detroit artist detailed various indignities, from being pulled over to getting kicked off the decks at Berghain. If this is what Parrish, a massively respected innovator within the form, faces day-to-day, what does that say about the general experience of Black artists within the club scene? What went wrong? CCL Blowing Up The Workshop 111 DJing isn't always art, but Blowing Up The Workshop, Matthew Kent's dearly departed mix series, reminded us that it often can be. The series was historically important, hosting mixes from Galcher Lustwerk and Ben UFO that stood the test of time. But the series also helped migrate the concept of DJing away from the utilitarian and towards the deeply personal. CCL's contribution to 111—the seven mixes that sent BUTW out on a high note—fit the bill. Kent described the set, which spanned from dream pop to dubstep, as "a beautiful collage that feels like the reason I started the series in the first place." Akash pulled together a wistful 30-minute set of Bollywood tunes for 111, complementing Chris SSG's masterful three-hour ambient set and Dr Banana's moody garage and 2-step mix, to name just a few. BUTW felt like a natural home for all of these disparate styles, and this freedom often led to mixes worth cherishing. Kent's now moved on from BUTW, focusing on Mana Records, the label he runs with Andrea Zarza, but with any luck, BUTW's boundless approach will persevere.

### Theo Parrish 
> Theo Parrish We Are All Gorgeous Monsterss Theo Parrish's We Are All Georgeous Monsterss is more than a DJ mix: it's a casually delivered manifesto.

### <a href="https://beatsinspace.bandcamp.com/album/josey-in-space">Josey In Space by Josey Rebelle</a> 
> <a href="https://beatsinspace.bandcamp.com/album/josey-in-space">Josey In Space by Josey Rebelle</a> Josey Rebelle Josey In Space Beats in Space Records In the first few minutes of Josey In Space, we hear beautiful poetry about the Black experience from Tenesha The Wordsmith and Daniel B. Summerhill, in the shimmering track "I Dream So Loud." "I've seen dreams deferred / As many times as I've seen kids wish upon them…. Now / Not later but right now / More than ever I dream so loud." In the next track, we hear a one-off vocal sample: "Can't we rebel or something?" Those words stay in our head as we listen to the rich, unpredictable, deeply personal mix that follows. The beauty of DJing is you can play literally whatever you want, something that Josey Rebelle, a DJ since the age of 13, understands more deeply than most. Josey In Space, the second official mix in Tim Sweeney's Beats In Space series, has the same eclectic flex as her club and radio sets, drawing an arc from '90s hardcore to chilled UK hip-hop via house, techno, acid and jungle. But it's also highly focussed, bringing together these disparate sounds to give us something carefully considered: a paean to Black club music over the last few decades, from both sides of the Atlantic. "Yes, music is beautiful, it makes you happy," Rebelle told Chal Ravens this year in a cover story for DJ Mag. "But it's also a serious business, and you approach those decks with serious intentions to destroy the dance floor." Here, Rebelle's intentions are less dance floor destruction, more musical storytelling. But the dedication to craft is no less intense. Arriving one year after the BBC's #1 Essential Mix of 2019, Josey In Space once again shows Rebelle to be one of her generation's best.

### Mix of the year 

## [2020's Best Tracks ](https://ra.co/features/3788)
Date: 2020-12-21T12:00:52.000Z

### Eris Drew Fluids Of Emotion Interdimensional Transmissions 
> When "Fluids Of Emotion" came out in February, Matt Unicomb's review asked, "Could this be the house record of the year?" Eris Drew's track makes a strong case for the title, all psychedelic breakbeat house with the same feeling of controlled chaos you get from her quick-fingered mixing of old rave records. The bounding drums, the uplifting harpsichord, the misty-eyed vocal sample: it's all put together with the love and intense emotion that defines Drew's signature sound. "It's the kind of track that unites a dance floor, so I hope I'm lucky enough to be on one when it gets played," Unicomb said. Most of us are still waiting for that opportunity. Luckily, the charm of "Fluids Of Emotion" feels timeproof, a rapturous feeling encased in wax. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Nazar Bunker feat. Shannen SP Hyperdub 
> Guerrilla, the illuminating debut album by Nazar, taught us something about the Angolan civil war. Rarely has electronic music tackled complex themes—politics, bloodshed, trans-generational trauma—in such a raw and compelling way. "Bunker," the second collaboration with London DJ and curator Shannen SP, was inspired by real-life events in Luanda in 1992, when Nazar's two older sisters barricaded themselves inside hotel rooms to avoid being found by government death squads. The anxiety is there in the helicopter whirrs and the cocking of guns. Both artists murmur lyrics in the detached drone of the shellshocked. Is that a knock at the door? The whole thing makes for harrowing listening. But still you go back for more. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Vytamin Outer Rim Terra Firma 
> It's like something from a nightmare: you release the biggest bomb of your life at a time when dance floors don't exist and socialising has been virtually outlawed. Not only that but your track is exceptionally festival-ready, all cosmic synths and fat breakbeats—the soundtrack, in other words, to a life-affirming dance floor moment. The good news is that "Outer Rim" isn't likely to be shelved any time soon. Tracks this special deserve a proper runout once parties return. Ravers must experience this beautiful banger in all its glory. Listen: Youtube

### DNGDNGDNG Hiperborea On The Corner Records 
> Peruvian duo Dengue Dengue Dengue planned a new alias for 2020's festival circuit. Abbreviated to DNGDNGDNG, the alias hasn't yet had a chance to live out its original intentions, but it was behind one of the year's standout EPs. Continentes Perdidos channels the mystical sound of, as the name translates, lost continents. On the highlight "Hiperborea," DNGDNGDNG excavate and innovate their Afro-Peruvian heritage. The record is rooted in the unpredictability of polyrhythmic structure; your ears try to follow one rhythm and before long, you're lost in a jungle full of them. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Andrew Ashong & Kaidi Tatham Washed In You Kitto Records 
> Andrew Ashong's last two releases—a collaboration with Theo Parrish and the go-to soul of his self-titled EP—date back to 2012 and 2014, so by October of this year we were long overdue another hit of his silky smooth voice. His 2020 mini-album, Sankofa Season, was well worth the wait, especially with the added bonus of broken-beat hero Kaidi Tatham on the buttons. "Washed In You," the effortlessly cool lead single, is everything you could wish for from the collaboration. Tatham's production pedigree shines through the skippy drums and roaming arrangement. His lush keyboard playing is the perfect accompaniment to Ashong's voice, as well as having its own moments to take centre stage. Sankofa Season marked the beginning of a new label project for the pair, Kitto Records. Hopefully there's more to come, and sooner rather than later. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### INT*era 548 Acting Press 
> INTe*ra is Vancouver's Hashman Deejay with PLO Man and C3Deee, two of the artists behind Acting Press. Aqueduct, their only release this year, shows what makes this label cult favorite, with six tracks that float between cosmic techno and a modern update of '90s West Coast ambient (see: Spacetime Continuum and his essential label, Reflective). "548" hovers gracefully between those sounds. Its atmosphere is part deep-sea, part deep-space, with a stepping techno pulse that enhances its weightless feel and a nine-minute runtime that makes it easy to get lost in. These guys do lush, transportive techno better than anyone, and this one showed them at the top of their game.

### Kush Jones Strictly 4 My CDJZ Vol. 8 Self-released 
> Kush Jones is committed to releasing 40 volumes of Strictly 4 My CDJZ. For anyone who follows the prolific producer's output, this goal seems well within reach. Opening the eighth volume of the EP series, "Bleep Bloop" is a clear standout from the series so far. There's punchy bass, soaring pads that drop and ascend like hovering airplanes, and as the cut's cheeky title references, an almost piercing melody that trickles throughout. Listen: Bandcamp / Soundcloud

### Anz Loos In Twos (NRG) Hessle Audio 
> Anz was one of 2020's success stories. First she turned heads with her mammoth spring/summer dubs 2020 mixtape, showcasing over 50 original tracks. Then she landed on Hessle Audio, an essential label for the kind of hybrid UK dance music she makes and plays. Her status as Manchester's new hero was cemented with "Loos In Twos (NRG)," where old-school rave synth stabs and breakbeats conspire for a lunging rhythm that sounds like it was designed to knock the needle off the record. Like so much of her music, it's a rush of energy and a ray of much-needed sunshine, a SAD lamp for a world without dance floors. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Terrence Dixon Galactic Halo Axis Records 
> The great thing about electronic music is that new trends appear periodically, giving us all a dose of something fresh. The other great thing is that some artists never change. Terrence Dixon belongs to the latter camp, a Detroit maverick who for 25 years has put out a steady stream of reliably excellent cosmic techno. This year's contribution to the canon was the Galactic Halo LP, which looked ahead to life on a strange planet in the year 2976. The standout track was "Quasar," a wonderfully simple roller built from a few bleeps and bloops ducking and diving across a firm pulse. Listen: Axis Records

### Pub Summer Ampoule Records 
> "Summer" is an anomaly on this list, as it was first released in 2000, during the golden era of dub techno. The Glaswegian artist Pub re-released it as a single this September, together with another glitchy ambient masterpiece on the flip. For many of us, this opened the floodgates to a vast and somewhat elusive discography, both his own and that of his prolific label, Ampoule. "Summer" sprawls out over 16 minutes, wandering leisurely and striking a perfect middle ground between ambient and dub techno. Its free-flowing, blissed out atmospheres will work perfectly for fans of Deepchord, Barker or Jan Jelinek. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Novelist Stay With Me Self-released 
> Novelist wore several hats in 2020—UK drill rapper, house producer, jungle MC—but the most surprising and compelling was the silky '80s sound of "Stay With Me." This love letter to Jesus, which came complete with a catchy chorus and belting sax solo, spotlighted the London artist's pop appeal and songwriting chops. There was a deeper message, too. Uploaded to Bandcamp the day before a major Black Lives Matter protest in London, "Stay With Me" was about remaining strong and hopeful in the face of adversity. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Karenn Shoes Off Voam 
> If there was a prize for the year's weirdest banger, it would have to go to Karenn's "Shoes Off." Blawan and Pariah lightened up their joint project in the past couple of years, from the artwork and track titles on their label, Voam, to the extremes of this trancey number. The austerity of their last label, Works The Long Nights, is a distant memory. That's not to say the new music doesn't bang as hard, but the pair seem intent on drawing more fun and unusual sounds out of their arsenal of hardware. "Shoes Off" is Exhibit A. Somehow a playful melody, gritty kicks and rips of bass gel together. For a moment you would be forgiven for thinking you're listening to Four Tet or Bicep, until the snarling bassline boxes you square in the face. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Wata Igarashi Eruption WIP 
> The first two releases on WIP, the new label from Wata Igarashi, caught the Japanese techno maestro in a serene mood. By the third, he was back on the dance floor. "Eruption" is like listening to 2020 in microcosm. The mood begins pleasantly enough, before an industrial scrape, faint at first, swells to a deafening roar, the sound of planes crashing and buildings collapsing. A flash of white noise, then, quick as anything, the thunder slips away, leaving the kick drums and churning bassline, only this time there's something else too, all feathery and glorious. Light, perhaps, at the end of the tunnel. Listen: Bandcamp / Soundcloud

### Donato Dozzy The Tao Samurai Music 
> A Donato Dozzy drum & bass EP had been coming. His DJ sets have been incorporating more and more D&B, he has released a 170 BPM remix for Samurai Music already, and his label Spazio Disponibile has issued two 12-inches of half-time mind-melters from Mike Parker. "Tao," the title track from Dozzy's EP for Samurai, is a technical marvel and a fresh approach to 170 (or 85) BPM, borrowing heavily from his slow-release style of techno. The EP as a whole is another inspired, diagonal step in his discography. Listen: Bandcamp / Soundcloud

### Azu Tiwaline Magnetic Service Livity Sound 
> Azu Tiwaline's sultry take on "meditation music" draws you into a deep and expansive listening experience. Refractions of her more dance-focused project Loan periodically pass through Magnetic Service, producing dub and minimal techno apparitions. All her releases under this moniker look to music as the coupling between humans and the natural world. Inspired by local environmental soundscapes in the El Djerid region of southern Tunisia where she lives, the EP has an elemental richness, thanks in part to her use of field recordings and atmospheric synths. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### ELLES summers_of_love Naive 
> "End Of The Night" comes as the relaxed, four-to-the-floor closer of an EP focused on electro and 2-step, like the exhausted but blissful finale of a good night out. It's a sumptuous cut of dream-house with warm pianos, blissful sustain strings and ELLES' shyly deadpan vocal delivery. What really makes this track special is all the little moments—the touches of bird song, the cymbal crashes after the breakdown, the way the vocals start to stutter and phase—that send chills down your spine. These are the ingredients that bittersweet club anthems are made of. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Nico Six Rooms EP Akita Club 
> Before releasing music as Nico, Mexican artist Nicolas Guerrero appeared on labels like L.I.E.S., Styles Upon Styles and Blank Slate, under the guise of White Visitation or WV. Since 2018, he has departed from the barreling techno of that alias, veering towards a more colourful and open-hearted sound. His 2020 mini-album Six Rooms goes further, in Nico's own words, "away from the club and into empty houses and abandoned pools." He has a way with vocal chops and syncopated drums—which attracted the keen ears of Batu's Timedance and Midnight Shift—and he deployed both gracefully on the Six Rooms highlight "One Day." Listen: Bandcamp

### TYGAPAW Run 2 U Naafi 
> "Run 2 U" is one of so many tracks released this year that longs to be played in a club. Tygapaw's debut album, Get Free, manages to be both tender and barreling, exploring self-liberation with meditative spoken word and dopamine-laced, '90s-Detroit influenced techno. Roughshod and bursting with energy, "Run 2 U" sits somewhere near the middle of the album. It's so entrancing that you might want run it back before continuing the journey. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Track of the year 
> Giggs Straight Murder (Giggs & David) feat. Dave No Bs Music Giggs and Dave, the two big stars of UK rap, couldn't be more different: Giggs is all presence and cheeky punchlines, while Dave is pure lyrical wizardry. Turns out, their styles complement each other. "Straight Murder (Giggs & David)," their second collaboration, showed both rappers at the top of their games, Dave relentless and razor-sharp, Giggs somehow both jovial and vicious. The wordplay is mind-blowing. And let's give a special shout-out to KeyzMusic, the man behind one of the best and most chilling beats of 2020. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud 2020 India Jordan For You Local Action India Jordan wrote For You to document the process of coming to terms with their queer identity. Taking cues from happy hardcore, drum & bass and house, the record opens with blissful house tracks "I'm Waiting (Just 4 U)" and the title track, recalling the late-night euphoria of last year's DNT STP MY LV. The "you" here refers to Jordan, who has recently come out to the public as non-binary. There's a feeling of triumph that emanates from "For You." The track shows Jordan's knack for chopping and looping vocal samples, this one employing the amorous hook of Change's "You Are My Melody." The loop never gets old, and as satisfying as the final climactic breakdown of the track is, when the familiar hook comes back around, it makes you wonder why it left in the first place. But the vocals aren't all that make the track pop. "For You" is swaddled in an addictive sunny feeling, thanks to funky guitar riffs, seesawing '80s synths and rousing percussion. The track captures the dizzying joy of finding true love—in this case, the love of one's self.

## [2019's Best Mixes](https://ra.co/features/3541)
Date: 2019-12-12T17:00:08.000Z

### Kelela & Asmara 
> Kelela & Asmara Aquaphoria Originally aired as part of Warp's NTS takeover, Kelela and Asmara's Warp mixtape feels like a jam session between friends. Asmara sculpts an undulating backing track out of music from Aphex Twin, Suzanne Kraft & Jonny Nash and Kareem Lotfy—artists that have helped define the recent era of ambient music. Kelela's airy, improvised vocals act are the perfect counterpart to Jaco Pastorius' genius bass solo and Iury Lech's emotional washes. They bring this floating, beatless music to an unforgettable climax. Lena Willikens & Vladimir Ivkovic Live: Nuits Sonores 2019 Headlining festival sets don't always work outside the original setting—as with well-timed jokes, you kinda had to be there. But leave it to Lena Willikens and Vladimir Ivkovic to make their three-hour Nuits Sonores odyssey suit nearly any context. It's meditative, weird and, lest we forget the main room dance floor it soundtracked, banging. Filled with the pair's characteristic slower selections, this mix feels like swimming inside a crystal ball. CCL Unsound Podcast 56 CCL called this mix a "regurgitated memory" of their Honcho Campout set, reflecting on the "more twisted hours… before the light had come up." That predawn unpredictability is what's so exciting here. One highlight is their adept pulling back with Codek's "Closer" before diving into a Metalheadz Wax Doctor rush. With these unreal transitions, and touches like the experimental Polish music that bookends the mix (a nod to Unsound) CCL shows the careful craft that sets them apart. Truly Madly GHOSTCAST 006 Ghostcast, a mix series from Berlin's favourite record store on wheels, has only released a few recordings since launching two years ago, but each is a window into a world of deep-digging DJs with exquisite house and techno collections. Truly Madly is one of them. An underground favourite who's steadily gaining recognition outside the world of trainspotters and Discogs geeks, the Londoner's set traverses classic techno, electro and house, cloaked with the same spacey charm that colours his club sets. Boards Of Canada Societas x Tape (NTS x Warp 30) Boards Of Canada are two of the most reclusive artists in electronic music, which means we don't know much about what they listen to during long stays in the Scottish countryside. Their Societas x Tape mix, a two-hour set broadcast on NTS as part of Warp's 30th anniversary, gives us an idea. Obscure electronics by Filmmaker, '80s post-punk by Killing Joke and synth-pop from Severed Heads tell us a little bit more about these pioneers. Dee Diggs FACT Mix 710 New York's Dee Diggs is on a quest to remind everyone that dance music is black music. Her FACT mix is her fiery mission statement, cutting through the history of black dance music, from Paris Is Burning and vintage acts like DJ Deeon and Karizma to NYC's new guard, including upstarts like Devoye and AceMo. This mix is classic, soulful and banging in all the right places, securing Diggs' own place in the canon she's charting. Eris Drew Raving Disco Breaks Vol. 1 On this year's funkiest mixtape, Eris Drew made some of dance music's most classic sounds her own. Raving Disco Breaks is composed of dance classics chopped into breaks on-the-fly by the American DJ, showcasing not only her impressive technical skills but also the emotional, spiritual and often nostalgic flair that makes her sets so electrifying. It's old-school technique with a new-school vibe. Francesco Del Garda Robert Johnson Archive 0002 Francesco Del Garda played this set at Robert Johnson on the banks of the Rhine a few days after Christmas last year. He couldn't have asked for a better setting: sun rising, perfect soundsystem, six-hour time slot, festive crowd. This recording, an edition of the Frankfurt club's new mix series, gives us only an hour of it, but it shows Del Garda on fire, indulging the uplifting sound that distinguishes him from his contemporaries. Batu Truancy Volume 240 Batu describes his Truancy mix as the closing set for a "festival in 2030 called Bristol-Bass." Given his Timedance label and his own inventive productions, he's in a good position to imagine the future of UK dance music. The mix’s backbone wiggles and booms with modern bass music, while making adventurous jumps from Latin and Afro-Caribbean rhythms to ambient techno and experimental club. Erika IT.podcast.s08e01 Erika's Interdimensional Transmissions podcast from March really lives up to the Detroit label's name: it sounds like you're hearing an actual transmission from another dimension. IT does down-the-rabbithole techno better than anyone, and this recording of Erika at an LA showcase for sister label Eye Teeth shows the sound at its cosmic, funky, head-spinning best. DJ Persuasion Dedicated To The Dedicated 94-95 Ask any junglist worth their salt: 1994 and '95 were the golden years. Disagree? Well, you might feel differently after listening to Dedicated To The Dedicated 94-95, the latest hour-long mix by '90s dance music fanatic DJ Persuasion, AKA Semtek. Every tune, most of them near-impossible to track down, writhes with rhythm and soul. The warm basslines and time-stretched vocals spark tingles of euphoria. When people say the '90s were better, this is the kind of thing they're thinking of. Sherelle LDN: Bass & Percs Special Earlier this year, Sherelle's debut Boiler Room session—a whirlwind of footwork, jungle and grime—went viral. While it's easy for some high BPM DJs to tire out their audience, her set maintains an addictive high energy throughout, with explosive, playful transitions that sparked the dance music equivalent of a mosh pit. Wait for the gutsy rewind at 23:40 that shot her to instant (and deserved) fame. Leif Freerotation 2019 Leif is part of a small group of DJs whose yearly sets at Freerotation festival in Wales always feel like a big deal. 2019 was no exception. In this recording, Leif redefines the peak-time set, starting slow and spindly before moving gracefully through many shades of cosy, rhythmic club music. There are tunes by Equiknoxx and Domu, Efdemin and Aphex Twin, all stitched together with extraordinary skill. As one SoundCloud commenter put it: "are you even human." Dr. Rubinstein Phonica Mix Series 56 Dr. Rubinstein is like an acid historian, wading through decades of dance music history to find the best 303 lines ever put to wax. Yet she still finds time in her Phonica mix to highlight several up-and-coming talents (Jack Roland, Gian) alongside more familiar names (DMX Krew, Adapta). Sometimes dark, sometimes bright, Phonica Mix Series 56 was a deeply psychedelic trip, weaving excellent electro and techno between forgotten acid bombs. As always with Rubinstein, the mixing was world-class, each transition bringing us further into her unique sound world. Leon Vynehall DJ-Kicks Last year, Leon Vynehall released Nothing Is Still, showing the world that his production chops extended way beyond the club. In 2019 he did something similar, but with DJing. His proof this time is a spellbinding DJ-Kicks mix, which blends genres, eras and moods together with sublime flow and dexterity. Dancehall, techno, pop, jungle, soul, a solo piano piece—what could've been a hot mess ends up as one of the classiest mix CDs in recent memory. re:ni Dekmantel Podcast 253 re:ni's Dekmantel podcast does everything right. The tracklist left the sleuths at mixesdb mostly stumped. The mixing is inspired, moving swiftly through tempos and styles with quick sleights of hand and extended blends. More than anything, though, its re:ni's ineffable sense of groove—slinky, fluid, always in flux—that makes this one really pop off. Turtle Bugg HNYPOT 330: African Art of Acid (Triple A Baybee) Mixx Turtle Bugg's Honey Soundsystem mix makes a point so simple it often goes unsaid: black people invented acid house. And yet, as he puts it, "There was no Second Summer Of Love in Amerikkka, no Ibiza for Negroes to spend their holiday, no beginnings of a multi-million dollar industry that could change the lives of Lady Liberty's bastard children." The voices of Dave Chappelle, Malcolm X and Derrick May ring out over interlocking acid lines. The message is clear: black ingenuity thrives, no matter who is paying attention. Ben UFO Hessle Audio - 9th September 2019 What makes this Hessle Audio show, one of many hosted by Ben UFO in 2019, so special? Well, it just is. On that early autumn night, armed with a stack of fresh wax, the UK DJ was on particularly impressive form, treating regulars and first-timer listeners to a beautifully woven tapestry of ambient, Afro techno, jungle and Joe. When it aired, it wasn't just nerds and ravers listening, either—Four Tet, Hunee, John Talabot and other dance music dons had all tuned in for their weekly dose of musical inspiration. Via App Crack Mix 307 Via App taps into the elemental energy of Brooklyn's techno underground on this mix for Crack, a set as volatile as any of their recent productions. This bumpy ride through jarring turns and interruptions, with its snarling, punkish spirit, hit harder than most other mixes we heard this year. <a href="/reviews/23502">Powder In Space by Powder</a> Powder Powder In Space You play Powder In Space once. You think, "This is nice." You leave it for a while, then play it a second and third time. You notice things like the Roy Brooks vocal, or Daphne's bubbling vibraphone melody, that you didn't catch the first time. You also realize you've fallen in love with it. This is how Powder's mix gets under your skin: her unobtrusive approach, drawn from offbeat house with gorgeous textures, waits for you to come around to it. Shannen SP DISCWOMAN 80 Alongside Kode9, Shannen SP runs Hyperdub's Ø events at London's Corsica Studios, a wonderful monthly midweek showcase of experimental music and art. She's quickly become a DJ to watch, and this mix for Discwoman showcases her knack for linking together sharp, angular beats with loose percussive rhythms—a style she sums up as "witchy black energy." Ciel FACT Mix 724 Cindy Li's FACT mix has a specific concept: "fast & light," inspired by hummingbirds. It also captures what makes her DJing so dynamic. The Toronto artist makes breakbeat, electro and techno float like feathers on the breeze, moving through quick-footed drum patterns and fluttering melodies with finesse. Her technique changes the feel of the music itself, which is among the highest compliments you can pay a DJ. Physical Therapy Live: Honcho Campout 2019 The Way In may have had the freakiest sounds at this year's Honcho Campout. Hours before CCL brought the dance floor to tears with Beat Happening, Physical Therapy unfurled this masterclass in trippy eclecticism. Cuts of perfectly dreamy drum & bass, a slo-mo version of Cece Peniston's "Finally" layered over Stenny’s "Stress Test," Andrew Weatherall's remix of St Etienne, D'Angelo's "Devil's Pie"—the highlights in this one are simply too many to name. From a punter's perspective, hearing a DJ with such unique style going for it like this is basically as good as it gets. Josey Rebelle Essential Mix "The thread that runs through the music I play, and my whole life, comes from my parent's generation," Josey Rebelle told us in 2017's Real Scenes: London film. Her parents are part of the Windrush generation, which arrived in the UK from the Caribbean in the 1950s and went on to make an inestimable impact on British life and culture. Rebelle's heritage pours out the speakers every time she's behind the decks. She's a quintessential London DJ: informed by the city's record shop and soundsystem culture, she's comfortable weaving together soul, techno, house, disco, R&B and jungle. Her first Essential Mix was dark and funky, with deep US music from Jamal Moss and Aybee featuring alongside London favourites Steven Julien and Cooly G. Ariel Zetina Truancy Volume 249 "Power to them sexy transsexuals out there, transforming the world," a woman intones in the opening moments of Ariel Zetina’s Truancy mix. It's one of many vivid vocal samples that contribute to the smartbar resident's sense of narrative. Beneath them, trippy acid house and soulful techno—much of it produced by other queer and trans artists—paint different moods. Sometimes it's raw and sexy, other times meditative and strange, but always charged with attitude and passion. Jackie House HNYPOT 300: Half A Bar Will Do It Jackie House's "Half A Bar Will Do It" mix came out 11 months ago, in that post-New Year's, deep-winter stretch of time when dance music in the Northern Hemisphere briefly goes into hibernation. It matches that mood perfectly, easing, over the course of three hours, through soothing, low-energy grooves of all kinds, from Kompakt deep cuts to ambient jungle pitched way, way down. Jackie's photo—swaddled in blankets, bathed in warm lamplight—shows the best way to take this one in. Nosedrip Live: Dekmantel Festival 2019 It's one thing to play a bunch of psychedelic dub and obscure post-punk on the radio. It's something else entirely to mix it at a festival and hold the dance floor. That's what Nosedrip did on the Red Light Radio stage at Dekmantel this summer. Luckily, we now have the recording to pogo to. In the STROOM head's hands, a rare Belgian cut like Siglo XX's "Individuality" becomes a statement of purpose: "I don't wanna be like the others / I am an originality / In search for individuality." Sybil Jason Blowing Up The Workshop 103 Sybil Jason's Blowing Up The Workshop mix is only 40 minutes long and it ends abruptly after a particularly satisfying transition. Showcasing her range, this quick, intense and blindsiding mix ranges from weirdo downtempo to synth-pop to techno, as Jason jumps between eras like a skilled time traveler. She had a bigger year than ever in 2019, and it's DJing skills like this that got her there. Spekki Webu Nous'klaer Radio #20 Though trance has been bubbling up again in dance music for a few years now, in 2019 it took centre-stage. While some turned to Eurodance for inspiration, Spekki Webu sought out the throb of the genre's earlier psychedelic forms. This precise set for Nous'klaer Audio is a masterclass in otherworldly DJing, journeying into hallucinogenic, hypnagogic soundscapes before it melts into the ether.

### Eris Drew 
> Eris Drew Raving Disco Breaks Vol. 1 On this year's funkiest mixtape, Eris Drew made some of dance music's most classic sounds her own. Raving Disco Breaks is composed of dance classics chopped into breaks on-the-fly by the American DJ, showcasing not only her impressive technical skills but also the emotional, spiritual and often nostalgic flair that makes her sets so electrifying. It's old-school technique with a new-school vibe.

### Leon Vynehall 
> Leon Vynehall DJ-Kicks Last year, Leon Vynehall released Nothing Is Still, showing the world that his production chops extended way beyond the club. In 2019 he did something similar, but with DJing. His proof this time is a spellbinding DJ-Kicks mix, which blends genres, eras and moods together with sublime flow and dexterity. Dancehall, techno, pop, jungle, soul, a solo piano piece—what could've been a hot mess ends up as one of the classiest mix CDs in recent memory.

### Physical Therapy 
> Physical Therapy Live: Honcho Campout 2019 The Way In may have had the freakiest sounds at this year's Honcho Campout. Hours before CCL brought the dance floor to tears with Beat Happening, Physical Therapy unfurled this masterclass in trippy eclecticism. Cuts of perfectly dreamy drum & bass, a slo-mo version of Cece Peniston's "Finally" layered over Stenny’s "Stress Test," Andrew Weatherall's remix of St Etienne, D'Angelo's "Devil's Pie"—the highlights in this one are simply too many to name.

### Mix of the year 

## [2019's Best Tracks](https://ra.co/features/3542)
Date: 2019-12-11T17:00:52.000Z

### Yu Su Little Birds, Moonbath feat. Michelle Helene Mackenzie Second Circle 
> Tring! There's a lot to say about "Little Birds, Moonbath," the enchanting new age track by Yu Su, but that sound (an alert string chord struck at a very high, slightly off-key pitch) is its distinguishing feature. It might be usefully compared to a sharp nudge from a friend ("Pay attention!") in the presence of something worth seeing, or in this case hearing. Those sounds are Michelle Helene Mackenzie's lace-like modular synth, the bucolic cascades of melody, and Yu Su's poetic, deep-in-the-mix spoken word. Where most ambient tracks aspire to emulate nature, "Little Birds, Moonbath" seems like an idealised vision of it.

### DJ Python Lampara Dekmantel 
> Listening to DJ Python's music feels like floating. It's soothing and a little whimsical, plus there's a depth of texture that gently hints at something more intense. On Derretirse, Brian Pineyro presents the dreamiest version of his characteristic deep reggaeton sound. Wavy opener "Lampara" is perfectly placed, welcoming you in pulses of glimmering synths and soft, slow drums. It eases into the more moving tracks on the record while also being a comforting moment to hang out in. "Lampara" puts the "warm" in warm up.

### Joe Get Centred Comeme 
> For a producer whose catalogue includes tracks built around a "seasick carnival organ," robotic meta-commentary and, of course, a "Claptrap," the title cut off Joe's Comeme debut felt relatively straightforward. Well, at least until you notice the track's tension stems from a 7/8 rhythm and dizzying syncopation. Like the best records in Joe's discography, this one makes you wonder, "How exactly did he come up with that?"

### Liquid Earth Origins Of Telluria TerraFirm 
> In the past few years, tech house has had a quiet renaissance. Liquid Earth, or Urulu, one of several producers rescuing the style from Beatport chuggagedon, has released a few of its most intriguing tracks this year. With its wiggly acid bassline and tweaked-out effects (best summed up as "crickets in outer space"), "Origins Of Telluria" echoes the OG Croydon style of tech house in its rolling, even-tempered arrangement. In the track's last quarter, some regal synth chords add a dash of high-tech soul to this trippy A-side.

### Whodat & Viola Klein Funeral Song Workshop 
> The frequent tempo changes in Whodat & Viola Klein's oddball house jam "Funeral Song" gave some DJs headaches. Luckily, its sunny, laid-back feel was perfectly suited to the early stages of a party, when crowds are still finding their feet. Anyway, who cares about a clang or two when you're treating the dance floor to the best Workshop track in years?

### LOFT That Hyde Trakk Tri Angle 
> Jungle sounded futuristic in the early '90s. Why are so many new artists obsessed with sounding like the old ones? "That Hyde Trakk" is jungle that feels new, and a track that LOFT (now known as AYA) has been working towards her entire career. The sounds are sleek, the rhythm changes brain-scrambling, the speed blinding. It's enough to make you astounded, perhaps like a new listener back in the old days.

### Amazondotcom A Flower, Nocturnal And Permanent Subreal 
> For a quick track, "A Flower, Nocturnal And Permanent" feels surprisingly at ease. Amazondotcom paces manipulated samples of birds chirping, leaves rustling and crowds muttering with blunt, jangly percussion and soft wobbles to let the space between the elements set the tone. Still, the pulse is more than persuasive enough to make dance floors move.

### DJ Haram No Idol Hyperdub 
> Philly-based artist DJ Haram makes music at the nexus of East Coast club and traditional Arab sounds. "No Idol" is the introductory track to her most recent EP, Grace. The track is a playful, extended dialogue between minimalist samples, from a stuttering flute trill to more dramatic sounds, like the weighty orchestral chorus that floods in halfway through.

### Slikback & Hyph11E ISHU SVBKVLT 
> Some of the freshest club music of 2019 came either from East Asia or East Africa, served up by labels like SVBKVLT, Hakuna Kulala and Nyege Nyege Tapes. One EP, a collaboration between Nairobi's Slikback and Shanghai's Hyph11E, was a product of both. The standout cut on Slip B was "ISHU," a fireball of manic rhythms, industrial noise and sudden stop-starts. Loud and ferocious, it's the sound of dance music's bleeding edge.

### Shygirl BB NUXXE 
> "There's only one winner in this bitch and I win everything," Shygirl snarls on "BB"'s closest thing to a chorus. It's hard not to believe her. Produced by Sega Bodega, this electrifying club beat comes alive with Shygirl's boastful MCing, the catchiest monotone we heard all year.

### Burial Claustro Hyperdub 
> At first glance, "Claustro" was another garage cut with R&B samples. Same old, same old, right? Wrong. This sizzler was a departure from the Londoner's typically mournful sound: pacier, brighter, more propulsive. And how about that finale? With 30 seconds to go, he performed a hard left turn into Eurodance melodies and chipmunk vocals. Only Burial could deliver two bangers in one track.

### Stenny Stress Test Ilian Tape 
> Despite his brilliant track record, you might not have expected a techno-oriented producer like Stenny to supply 2019's most robust UK garage experiment. Like many new 2-step productions, "Stress Test" plays directly from the dark and minimal El-B playbook, but it's delivered with the fresh enthusiasm of a garage dilettante. While it ditches garage's bubbly effervescence for a more stone-faced delivery, its firm execution stands out.

### Alec Falconer Cab Sauve (Harry Wills Sour Grapes Dub) Entity London 
> Of the various factions comprising UK garage's new wave, Harry Wills, Alec Falconer and co. are the psychedelic minimalists. By emphasising the style's loose-limbed swerve and restraining its lairy tendencies, productions like Wills' "Cab Suave" remix make a snug fit with trippy house and stripped-back techno. There's a hint of minimal's jerky oddness in the mix, too. The play of organ, stab and synth recalls both Perlon and Groove Chronicles, a key trait distinguishing this school's brand of garage from the crowd.

### Instinct Pistolwhip Instinct 
> Instinct, a side project from the UK producer Burnski, embodies a sound that's crept to the fore these past few years: deep club cuts at the crossroads of minimal, tech house and garage. The series has had lots of great moments, but its high water mark so far is "Pistolwhip," a floor-filler with the sinister air of druggy minimal but a stepping rhythm and vocal hook that are pure UKG. No wonder this sleeper hit was a DJ favorite all year.

### ZeroFG Renegade Steppa Dr Banana 
> The excellent label (and clothing brand) Dr Banana releases classic UKG along with new stuff, and while some old tunes inevitably steal the show (last year's "Romantic Call"), the current artists on their records really hold their own. On Dr Banana 07, new tracks from Holloway and ZeroFG outshone old ones from Sky Joose and DJ Texta, especially ZeroFG's "Renegade Steppa." Dark and trippy with an evil bassline, this one feels fresh in a way only new music can.

### Four Tet Dreamer Text Records 
> Tracks by Kieran Hebden have been soundtracking summers for more than a decade. Where 2019's other Four Tet hit, "Only Human," harnessed the power of a well-chosen vocal sample, "Dreamer" is all about shimmering textures and shuffling percussion. At just three minutes long, this was tough to work into DJ sets, but that didn't stop "Dreamer" becoming one of the most popular tunes of the year. Another summer, another Four Tet smash.

### Peggy Gou Starry Night Gudu Records 
> Peggy Gou couldn't have set the scene for this tune more clearly. "Starry Night," a wavy piano house tune flecked with acid lines and vocals mulling the fleeting nature of popularity, is lush and inviting like a humid evening breeze. As slick as shimmery house comes (with a dazzling video to match), it funnels all of Gou's strengths into one radiant package.

### S.A.M. Fury's Laughter Delaphine 
> Remember Peter Bjorn And John's "Young Folks," the indie pop smash with that insanely hummable melody? "Fury's Laughter," by Samuel André Madsen, might be the house music equivalent. Its whistling earworm was catnip to sun-drenched dance floors in 2019, a tune so catchy 76,000 ravers felt compelled to whip out Shazam. (Context: those are incredible numbers for an underground house track.) Could this be the record that finally catapults one of dance music's unsung heroes into the spotlight?

### Marie Davidson Work It (Soulwax Remix) Ninja Tune 
> This time 13 years ago, dancers were jumping around to Simian Mobile Disco's "Hustler," a track with a deadpan vocal that helped define the blog house era of the '00s. The "Hustler" for summer 2019 was Soulwax's remix of Marie Davidson's "Work It," which resurrected last year's most addictive vocal for a jacking, high-energy bomb that lit up festivals big and small. As they've done so many times before, Soulwax made a hit track even bigger.

### Nathan Micay The Party We Could Have LuckyMe 
> Plenty of artists made and played trance this year, but few did it with the passion of Nathan Micay. "The Party We Could Have" is the kind of out-and-out late-'90s worship we've been waiting for him to make all along. It so unabashedly goes for it (listen to those belching basslines) that it could put a smile on even the most ardent trance-hater's face, becoming an explosive summit hit through bliss, and sheer force.

### Aurora Halal Eternal Blue (Wata Igarashi Crossing Remix) Mutual Dreaming Records 
> Aurora Halal once described a formative techno experience with terms like "clarity of sound," "3D spectrum of frequencies" and "high-definition psychedelic emersion." That's pretty much what you get on Wata Igarashi's remix of her track "Eternal Blue." All dizzying arpeggios and impossibly crystalline sounds, touched with that sense of cosmic drama Igarashi does so well, it's the kind of techno that calls to mind the expanding brain meme, and that, on the right soundsystem, could give you a proper out-of-body experience.

### Rosa Anschütz Rigid (Kobosil 44 Rush Mix) R - Label Group 
> A push-and-pull between light and dark, happy and sad, is central to plenty of great music. Kobosil's "44 Rush Mix" of Rosa Anschütz's "Rigid" found a perfect ratio between different moods, pairing pained, droning vocals with a thundering techno instrumental that, at times, feels euphoric. The result was one of the most powerful techno tracks of 2019, and a high point in Kobosil's career.

### Paula Temple Joshua And Goliath (Techno Version) Noise Manifesto 
> Techno doesn't get many anthems, but "Joshua And Goliath" was one of 2019's. The sonic equivalent of a wrecking ball smashing through a burnt-out warehouse, Paula Temple's peak-time bomb still manages to feel musical, a churning chorus of synths with plenty of moving parts. Not every techno DJ was brave enough to unleash it on a crowd, but those who did sent dance floors into meltdown.

### VTSS Fruition Intrepid Skin 
> Love gnarly techno? How about EBM? Two yeses? Then this was your year. One of the stars in this camp was VTSS, the Berlin-based Pole whose no-nonsense DJ sets took her to new and far-flung places in 2019. Her productions helped, too, namely "Fruition," a stormy banger with craggy textures and gruesome artwork. But beneath the murk there was something else: a beautiful melody as wispy and delicate as frost.

### Varg A Weak Heart To Break (BD 4-Ever) Northern Electronics 
> "It's funny because I have a bunch of techno bangers that I keep making, but it's not really what I like to present," Varg told RA this year. "A Weak Heart To Break (BD 4-Ever)" is the highlight from two EPs of straight-up techno bangers, bundling Varg's contradictions into one trance-tinged steamroller. It's hard not to be taken by its melodies, an outpouring of emotion that makes Varg's music so universal.

### Off The Meds Belter (Joy O Belly Mix) Studio Barnhus 
> "Confident will be playing this in 20 years," tweeted Ben UFO of Joy O's "Belly Mix" of "Belter." What might make it so replayable? That could be closely tied to the much-discussed decline of dance floor anthems. If our collective appetite for bright, hooky hits (Joy O's "Ellipsis" being one) has waned, then "Belly Mix" is one possible mutation: the don't-feel-good track. Where Off The Meds' Kamohelo Khoaripe seems like the story's enigmatic anti-hero, Joy O's sour bassline is the seedy antagonist.

### Kosh Keep Hope Alive Casa Voyager 
> DJs love Casa Voyager, the Moroccan house, techno and electro label named after a train station, because of tracks like Kosh's "Keep Hope Alive." Fat, spacey and emotional, this rolling house track is best played sometime deep into the night, its bubbling bassline preparing the dance floor for lift-off into outer space.

### Deniro Monsoon 2 Tape Records Amsterdam 
> For the last few years, Deniro's techno records for labels like Trip and Tape Records have skewed towards the left-of-centre. "Monsoon 2," a percussive techno track, was more understated. It's shuffling percussion was built for classy DJ sets, rolling with the easygoing bounce of classic techno. This wasn't the flashiest techno track of the year, but it was one of the slickest.

### Karima F Random Loop From Doepfer Site Schloss 
> The Norwegian producer Karima F's breakout track is all about patience. It starts out as a simple breakbeat loop, building slowly before an organ loop locks the groove into place. It's not so much a drop as a gear shift, one that could give a set a jolt of energy. It's the rare track that finds an anthemic quality in restraint, simmering below boiling point while its melody wriggles into your head.

### CCL x Flora FM Liquify Interference Planet Euphorique 
> One of two collaborations from the Seattle-based artists this year (the other being "Winding Plod," which lives up to its name, off Bandcloud's excellent charity compilation), "Liquidity Interference" lands directly on the dance floor. The drums are crisp, and there's so much space you can almost hear each percussion hit. Then melodic synths soar overhead, bringing a lightness to those hours when the music has taken over control of your movement.

### Leila Samir Anxiety More Time 
> Leila Samir's No Music EP was a shining debut that immediately garnered approval from the likes of Andrew Weatherall and Zaltan. The first single, "Anxiety" snipped elements of Saudi Arabian music, techno and hard drum to produce something scornful and foreboding. Leading with unassuming synths, it isn't long before it descends into a rapidly intensifying rhythm.

### Air Max '97 Bruxis Timedance 
> Air Max '97 has coined an apt term for his bludgeoning genre of music: "horror dance." "Bruxis" is a great example of this off-kilter style, incorporating squalls of slashing knives, a mischievous horror film soundtrack melody and extraterrestrial vocals. But Air Max '97 isn't about cheap thrills. At one point, he delivers a perfectly timed, suspenseful break. After the mayhem, it feels well deserved.

### Lara Sarkissian Peninsula All Center 
> On "Peninsula," the Club Chai cofounder Lara Sarkissian evokes an epic scene. It's a grey morning on an ancient battlefield, and thunderous hand drumming is calling troops to war. A sense of mystery builds as metallic groans and eerie duduk, an Armenian woodwind, slither through the complex rhythms. But the percussion's controlled intensity never falters, resulting in a strange but powerful experimental club bomb.

### Yak Umbra version 
> In 2019, Version moved on from the reduced dubstep it does so well for more adventurous explorations of rhythm. And who better for this than Sheffield's finest beat twister, Yak? "Kaepora," the B-side on Version 013, is the German label's most striking track yet, and perhaps Yak's as well. A mirage of sun-dappled vocals and shimmering drums set to a nonstandard 115-BPM rhythm, it is utterly unconventional, but so lush and groovy you might not notice.

### DJ Plead Salt And Pepper Nervous Horizon 
> DJ Plead's music is rooted in Lebanese and Syrian music traditions, along with UK house and bass. "Salt And Pepper" is an experimental take on Arab beats, complete with the soulfulness of the best UK funky. With frenetic, looping percussion and searing synths, this is DJ Plead's most compelling track this year.

### Special Request VORTEX 164 (Sully Remix) Houndstooth 
> Paul Woolford's "VORTEX" originals were all about the primitive thrill of a slowly rising tone. Sully's remix succeeds by taking a harder route, doing away with Woolford's ultra-effective motif in favour of a specific idea. He focusses on turning breakbeats into pitched, melodic material, twisting drums into razor-sharp tonal swords that slice and dice with the best of the '94 school.

### Galaxian Coming Up For Air Ilian Tape 
> Galaxian is synonymous with electro, but his standout work of 2019 recalls vintage Christoph De Babalon. This is a war of the worlds, where apocalyptic despair faces off with dead-eyed violence, but a furtive glimmer of hope watches on. Juggernaut hoover, tortured, pulverised breaks and awe-inspiring pads don't just tug at the heartstrings, they rip them clean off. But for all its horror, "Coming Up For Air"'s true power resides in that it's ultimately a redemptive experience. Its confronting emotional honesty disturbs but purifies.

### Djrum Hard To Say R&S Records 
> Djrum's sound is a high-wire balancing act between high intensity and big emotions. When the two are properly poised, the results inspire a hypersensorial awe. "Hard To Say," which Djrum cheekily described as "ambient gabber," might represent the pinnacle of this high-risk, high-reward approach. The grizzly distortion that usually accompanies 909 kicks at 150+ BPM speeds is counterpoised by a milky, post-dubstep ambience. Djrum's nosebleed drums and emulsifying atmosphere combine with transcendent force.

### Double 99 Ripgroove (Fixate Remix) Ice Cream Records 
> It was the rewind heard round the world. The track? A rowdy edit of a rowdy UK garage tune that seemed to possess Sherelle, whose performance went viral and rocketed her to fame. On its own, "Ripgroove" is a force. But Fixate, somehow, makes it harder with an edit that combines speed garage and jungle. It's the kind of hybridism that's made him one of the scene's more exciting producers. Thankfully, Ice Cream Records came out of retirement to release his version officially.

### Homemade Weapons Svalsat (Donato Dozzy Remix) Samurai Music 
> Donato Dozzy has played drum & bass in DJ sets for a few years now, but this earthshaking remix of Homemade Weapons marks his first venture into the genre as a producer. Enmeshing the original's foreboding drones and breathless gasps in a web of spiralling rhythms, Dozzy's signature control of tension and release summons a force of tectonic pressure. This is drum & bass made with a techno philosophy, resulting in a lethal roller with an unstoppable momentum.

### Afrodeutsche I Know Not What I Do River Rapid 
> This year, Afrodeutsche emerged as one of dance music's most exciting newcomers. That's thanks to tracks like "I Know Not What I Do." Deep and spacey, this techno-electro hybrid was one of the trippiest tracks of 2019, a low-slung groover perfect for DJ play long after peak-time. Loopy and subtle, it dazzled clubbers all over the world.

### Eris Moloko Cabaret Recordings 
> "Moloko" was yet another excellent transmission from Cabaret Recordings, a label that specialises in spacey, subtle sounds. Pitched somewhere between techno and house, Eris's second official release featured three solid tracks, but "Moloko" was best of all. Its rolling groove and humming bassline were built for DJs spinning to afterhours crowds, the kind of tune that convinces everyone to stay a little bit longer.

### Gene On Earth Lunchbox Music Limousine Dream 
> When a digging veteran like DJ Koolt plays "Lunchbox Music," clubbers might be shocked, then pleased, to learn it came out in 2019. Many of Gene On Earth's contemporaries are trying to give their productions just this type of magic, but they rarely sound so much like a bonafide classic.

### Stanislav Tolkachev When I Was A Boy Semantica Records 
> Stanislav Tolkachev possesses techno's most recognisable style, but he still finds ways to surprise us. This year, that surprise came in the form of "When I Was A Boy," a rare instance of the Ukrainian maestro using anything close to a conventional melody. That melody what made "When I Was A Boy" a perfect option for late-hour DJ sets, where its ambiguous mood was entrancing.

### Mor Elian Radical Spectacular Fever AM 
> What makes a great afterhours track? In other words, which music works best for tired legs and addled minds? Dainty melodies usually go down a treat, especially when they dance with the ease and flair of a Bolshoi ballerina. This describes the centrepiece of Mor Elian's "Radical Spectacular," a sunrise track with dynamic drums and bags of joie de vivre. Love Oni Ayhun's timeless classic? Then this one's for you.

### Carl Gari & Abdullah Miniawy Zawaj Whities 
> For "Zawaj," the German trio Carl Gari laid down what might be the most desolate soundscape of the year. The Arabic vocals, sung by Abdullah Miniawy over its over its haunting tones, were just as powerful. The abstract poem, delivered in Miniawy's mother tongue, captured the beauty of Arabic, a language claiming its place in electronic music.

### Ghostride The Drift Untitled B3 XPQ? 
> For the shadow network of ambient producers stretching from Moscow to Berlin, Philadelphia to Tokyo, the artists Exael, uon and Huerco S are key connectors. Due to locality, these nodes mostly communicate online, but Ghostride The Drift happened when those three got in the same room. "Untitled (B3)" is a slurry of ambient, textural improv, dub techno and IDM experimentation that feels like it could have been made in 1994, the present, or some far-off future.

### Kali Malone Sacrificial Code iDEAL Recordings 
> It's appropriate that Kali Malone's organ dirge lands in this section. The American musician relocated to Sweden eight years ago, attracted to the country's improvised music scene. "I noticed that it was very careful and considerate of the other musicians," she said. "And it inspired a different sort of listening in me." On her second album of durational organ music, Malone adopts the language of liturgy ("sacrifice," "glory" and "worship") but her ritual involves adhering to strict, harmonic rules. On tracks like "Sacrificial Code," this discipline results in transcendence.

### Ana Roxanne It's A Rainy Day On The Cosmic Shore Leaving Records 
> Ana Roxanne's debut EP, ~~~, felt more like a private audio diary than a calculated unveiling, and with good reason. Recorded in 2015, ~~~'s uncanny mix of new age, ambient and R&B went practically unheard until finding its way to the Leaving Records cofounder Matthewdavid. "It's A Rainy Day On The Cosmic Shore" combines field recordings of waves with loops and drones coaxed from a vintage Moog Synthesizer IIIP. In the Californian artist's hands, simple gestures feel magical.

### Félicia Atkinson Moderato Cantabile Shelter Press 
> The first track on Félicia Atkinson's The Flower And The Vessel is just bare whispering over silence. The second, "Moderato Cantabile," rouses the album's musical environment. It begins with a distant crystal tone, gently discovering new layers of sound and texture, with piano parts and organic samples floating through. Sinking in feels sedating, intimate and a bit wistful, a portal into the French avant-garde artist's quiet sound world.

### James Massiah Natural Born Killers (Ride For Me) Levels 
> The London poet James Massiah's debut EP came with the visual of the year. The Ian Pons Jewell-directed clip depicts a surreal scorcher in Buenos Aires, which is somewhat ironic, as "Ride For Me" sounds unmistakably like London. It captures the roll and swagger of the British capital, finding an easy middle-ground between early Chicago house and eski. Just as Massiah's poetry often relies on the inflection of his voice, "Ride For Me"'s addictive quality hinges on his relaxed, confident delivery.

### LSDXOXO HATESHOPPING PDA 
> LSDXOXO is a wizard when it comes to edits, and his version of SOPHIE's "Faceshopping" might be his crown jewel. Out of all his tracks, this was the one you heard the most this year, which comes down to its simplicity: the vocal is flattened out into a hypnotic hook, and the track gallops along with the grace of classic techno. There are no bells and whistles, just a new-school attitude and an old-school spirit.

### AceMo Where They At ? ? ? feat. John FM Self-released 
> The most played track off AceMo's All My Life EP is the infectious "Where They At ? ? ?" The simple, recognizable synth line from Robin S. 's "Show Me Love" is given a modern thrust with the help of AceMo's lo-fi synths and John FM's catchy vocals, which shout out girls from the "self-made" to the "brown berets." Soulful with a political edge, this dominated New York's clubs this year.

### Octo Octa Can You See Me? T4T LUV NRG 
> Octo Octa knows a simple line of reassurance can mean the world. Given her experience as a trans woman, you can't help but feel the vocal on "Can You See Me?" is meant to soothe oppressed peoples' silent pain, especially those rendered structurally invisible. "I know exactly how you feel!," the track's single line repeats. Soaring over a wistful house jam, it's a comforting message.

## [2019's Best Albums](https://ra.co/features/3540)
Date: 2019-12-10T16:50:47.000Z

### Loraine James For You And I Hyperdub 
> For You And I was born in the daydream of a girl gazing out the window of the estate tower on its cover. As Loraine James recently told Pitchfork, her Hyperdub debut is an intensely personal album, exploring the forces, good and bad, that shape her existence as a queer black woman in London. Jagged and smooth, anxious and romantic, swiftly skating through glitch, ambient and grime, it's as fresh and addictive as anything the London label's put out for years. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### DJ Nigga Fox Cartas Na Manga Príncipe 
> On Cartas Na Manga, the wild energy that ran through Rogério Brandão's trailblazing records for Príncipe and Warp was funnelled into something darker and woozier. Tracks like "Água Morna" presented a slower take on Brandão's trademark batida-inspired rhythms, while "Sub Zero" and "Nhama" plunged deeper into the Angolan-born, Lisbon-based artist's exceptional percussion toolkit. With Afrodiasporic sounds shaking clubs and festivals everywhere from Los Angeles to Kampala, Cartas Na Manga marked Brandão as a leading light for this global community. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Efdemin New Atlantis Ostgut Ton 
> On New Atlantis, Efdemin achieved a subtle landmark, merging the experimental impulses of the records he makes as Phillip Sollmann with the sublime melodic techno he's built his name on. Fantastical instruments like the "sing-drum" waft in and out of the mix, giving the album an otherworldly feel befitting its inspiration, an unfinished 17th-century work of utopic fiction. New Atlantis was Efdemin's first album for Ostgut Ton, and it played a crucial part in the Berghain-affiliated label's extraordinary year. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Coil The Gay Man's Guide To Safer Sex +2 Musique Pour La Danse 
> Coil are best-known for occult experiments in electronic music, but this brilliant reissue from Musique Pour La Danse captures a lesser-known side of the English: their early '90s flirtation with dance music. What was originally written to soundtrack an educational film about gay sex from 1992 ended up becoming one of 2019's unlikeliest hits, and no wonder—the New Age sheen, Balearic tempo and trippy vocal hooks make each of these songs irresistible. A lush introduction to one of electronic music's most important bands. Listen: Bandcamp / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Nkisi 7 Directions UIQ 
> 7 Directions feels at once ancient and futuristic. Nkisi's rhythms tap into the eternal beat of Congolese percussion music but the aesthetic presentation is hypermodern. There are also retrofuturisms in the mix, too—her pads often recall the stargazing drama of Detroit techno, while the white-knuckled intensity of hardcore bristles beneath the surface. For all its time- and space-spanning richness, the execution is powerfully spartan, making this an economical but profound world-building experience. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Various 30 Years Of Rage Part 1 & 2 Above Board Projects 
> 30 Years Of Rage, a four-part compilation by Fabio and Grooverider, is the story of how jungle came to be. The London club night's music policy was far from a straight line through the "hardcore continuum"—besides the conveyor belt of British post-acid-house records, the compilation includes Plus 8 anthems, Frankie Bones breakbeats and, as Joe Muggs wrote, "off-its-tits sunrise house." The set shows not only the fertile conditions for jungle's emergence, but that it took Fabio and Grooverider's imaginative DJing to bring it to life. Listen: Bandcamp / Spotify

### Anthony Naples Fog FM ANS 
> If Anthony Naples' last album was made for low-key afterparties, Fog FM rewinds (or fast-forwards) to a heaving dance floor. It's pitch-black and someone has been going OTT with the smoke machine. The tunes are detailed and twisted, full of strange melodies, zippy rhythms and slamming basslines. You feel disorientated yet at ease. Later in the night, the music softens to house. There's even some ambient. From open till close, you're completely lost in the music. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Ossia Devil's Dance Blackest Ever Black 
> Devil's Dance was the year's best dub techno record. The form, though, was a radical departure from the Basic Channel school. Ossia's first album essentially reimagined the style as a rootsier product of Bristol rather than Berlin. What also set the album apart was its supernatural bent, a detached unreality comparable to films like Jacob's Ladder and Enter The Void. Whether on heavyweight thudders like "Hell Dub," the hall-of-mirrors sax of "Rubble" or the 23-minute driftathon "Vertigo," Devil's Dance evoked something like an out-of-body experience. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Octo Octa Resonant Body T4T LUV NRG 
> Each of Maya Bouldry-Morrison's albums mirrors her journey as a trans woman in a deeply personal way. Where her earlier records were moody and introverted, her third LP, Resonant Body, finds a new sense of empowerment. Released through T4T LUV NRG, the label she launched this year with her partner, Eris Drew, Resonant Body serves up vintage breaks and joyous house jams, further fueled by love-preaching vocals. As the artist said in an interview: "This record is different from my other ones, mostly because I'm just happier than I've been." Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Lifted 2 PAN 
> Getting talented musicians in a room and expecting great things to happen often leads to disappointment. The joy of 2, the second album by Lifted, is that it seems to have much humbler aspirations. The music, loosely inspired by ECM-style jazz, flows like a rambling, beers-round-the-sofa chat among friends, the instruments interplaying with a conversational rhythm. The players— Max D, Jeremy Hyman, Motion Graphics, Matt Papich—could have been a leftfield-house supergroup. But that wouldn't have been nearly as much fun. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### E-Saggila My World My Way Northern Electronics 
> Techno, gabber, noise, breakcore, with the occasional metal shriek thrown in—whatever My World My Way is exactly, it's more DIY basement show than European nightclub. In fact, it makes most club music look woefully safe, which might explain how it landed on Northern Electronics, the label co-run by techno's enfant terrible, Varg. Awe-inducing in its power and chaos, My World My Way has an attitude you might wish was more common in electronic music. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Oli XL Rogue Intruder, Soul Enhancer Bloom 
> "I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?" The line is borrowed from Beck's 1994 hit "Loser," but it sounds right at home on Oli XL's debut album, which is anxious, self-deprecating, funny and banging in equal measure. Homing in on a unique sound that combines the skip of UK garage and the autotuned lilt of modern hip-hop, the Swedish artist puts an irresistibly funky spin on bedroom pop. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Moor Mother Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes Don Giovanni 
> On her most striking album yet, Camae Ayewa weaves slave narratives, experimental jazz and negro spiritual samples into an end result that is equal parts haunting and empowering. Her knack for poetics and storytelling shines as she unfurls stories dispelling linear notions of time, intimately conveying the rage and anxiety of our political climate. On Analog Fluids Of Sonic Black Holes Ayewa channels this fury into a fiery call for mobilization, backed up with buzzing modular sounds that feel like they're carrying you through space and time. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### PTU Am I Who I Am Trip 
> It's never been easier to break the rules than it is today. But acts of creative rebellion can often sound unfocused or even immature. Am I Who I Am, from the Russian duo PTU, might at first seem like that sort of LP, but there's a loose philosophy that governs this mad record. PTU are residents of "techno's strange sector"—the album's strength is that this description feels like an understatement. But for all the LP's weirdo impulses (it's introduced by a cyborg reading 1984) what stood out most in PTU's uniquely odd world was a cheeky, Cheshire Cat charisma. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Sarah Davachi Pale Bloom W.25TH 
> For Pale Bloom, Sarah Davachi reduced her music down to its barest essence—classical solo piano—and then, one by one, carefully added hallmarks from her discography of otherworldly drone music. The LP gradually develops with swirls of organ, hums of string and quivering vocals, starting from nothing and growing into something intricate and complex. It's the most difficult, intense and rewarding album from an artist whose music rings loudest at its most quiet and tender. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Floating Points Crush Ninja Tune 
> Sam Shepherd is the cleverest composer to emerge from UK dance music this decade. But Crush succeeds by tempering his studious impulses with a dash of raw energy. Written in just a few weeks, Crush shows Shepherd trusting his impulses. His cultivated take on harmony still dominates, but it feels all the richer alongside rough and tumble drum work. And unlike his debut album, Elaenia, it treats us to genuine Flo Po floor-fillers, too. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Bogdan Raczynski Rave 'Till You Cry Disciples 
> Bogdan Raczynski's madcap personality cloaks his music in absurdity. But beneath the hooligan trappings, Rave 'Till You Cry is disarmingly heartfelt and diaristic. These qualities aren't often associated with so-called braindance, which makes Raczynski's complex yet slapdash music oddly intimate. In today's professionalised dance music climate, wacky recluses like Raczynski come off like relics of authenticity. Rave 'Till You Cry then is a much-needed talisman for a spotlight-dodging artist who deserves all the attention he can get from new listeners discovering the Rephlex catalogue. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Boreal Massif We All Have An Impact Pessimist Productions 
> Climate change—we're fucked, right? Pessimist and Loop Faction, AKA Boreal Massif, certainly think so. Or do they? A sense of dread hangs heavy over their excellent debut album, We All Have An Impact, evoked via icy synths, leaden trip-hop beats and track titles like "The Brink Of Extinction." But it's not all doom and gloom. Some of the LP's best moments, like the frayed guitar on "Angel Of Dub," are tender and delicate. A sliver of hope, perhaps. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Oil Of Even Pearl’s Un-Insides Remix Album SOPHIE Self-released 
> SOPHIE's remix album is predictably iconoclastic. Technically, it's not so much a remix album as a two-part mix made entirely of her own remixes of her own tracks. It's available only on YouTube, or, naturally, with a limited-edition clutch bag. It's also wall-to-wall heat, transforming the subversive pop of her debut album into killer house and techno, bringing SOPHIE back to the dance floors where she first came to prominence. Listen: Spotify

### The Caretaker Everywhere At The End Of Time (Stage 6) History Always Favours The Winners 
> When Leyland Kirby announced The Caretaker project was coming to a close, few could have imagined how harrowing the end would be. Everywhere At The End Of Time (Stage 6) evokes the final stage of dementia, when mental processes break down completely. The music is some of the bleakest drone you'll ever hear, with Kirby's ballroom refrains obscured by a terrifying blankness. He calls it "listenable chaos," but that depends on how listenable you find the dissolving of a mind in real-time. Listen: Bandcamp / Soundcloud

### Lafawndah Ancestor Boy Concordia 
> Since she stepped onto the scene, Lafawndah's work has been steeped in the vast world of experimental club music. Her debut album is her most evocative project yet, with soft-spoken but boldly delivered sentiments on geography, identity and intimacy. Merging club, Middle Eastern rhythms, moombahton and pop with sensual R&B vocals, Ancestor Boy draws from global influences without losing its singular appeal. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Karenn Grapefruit Regret Voam 
> We had to wait until November to get what might be 2019's best techno album, a heavy-duty double-pack from Blawan and Pariah. Released eight years after their landmark debut as Karenn, Grapefruit Regret captured what's magical about their raw, energetic sound, perhaps best reflected in the blistering highlight "Crush The Mushrooms." The pair recorded the album's eight tracks during an "intense" studio session, harnessing their extensive modular setup to create an explosive techno record. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Jenny Hval The Practice Of Love Sacred Bones Records 
> On this striking LP for Sacred Bones, the Norwegian musician and novelist Jenny Hval dismantles abiding notions about love, digging into the historical, psychosexual and political aspects of this most essential part of the human experience. Her sound of choice is expansive dance pop that nods towards trance's euphoric potential. The combination of these elements is a triumph, an improbable inversion of love's inherent conservatism towards artistic and personal freedom. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Barker Utility Ostgut Ton 
> There are no kicks on Sam Barker's debut LP, Utility. And yet, the album is as fit for the club as it is for deep listening, a special balance the Leisure System cofounder achieved only after more than a decade of experimentation. Using unconventional rhythms and sound design, Barker combines the euphoria of trance, the movement of techno, the expansiveness of ambient and the detail of IDM. The result is an impressive challenge to the established dance floor formula. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Various Fingertracks: Vol. 1 ESP Institute 
> In the age of reissue mania, Fingertracks Vol. 1 felt refreshingly personal, hearkening back to a specific place (Southern California) and time (the mid-to-late '00s, when Andrew Hogge shared 1000 deep cuts on lovefingers.org). Lovefingers' original list presaged the sound and attitude of the "selector" movement, but at the end of the day, it was a labor of love. From Italian minimalism to private-press psych, Fingertracks replicates the feeling of listening to records in the living room of a vastly knowledgeable friend. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Flying Lotus Flamagra Warp Records 
> When big budgets and big ambitions collide, it's usually a mess. Across a string of excellent records, Flying Lotus has earned the trust to meander off-piste. Flamagra is core FlyLo: funky basswork, zig-zagging beats and sweeping strings are all present. With a starry guest cast that includes Solange, George Clinton and David Lynch, the beatmaker explores moments of lucidity and despondency that occur when you crash back down to earth from a psychedelic high. It makes for one of his most varied and compelling albums to date. Listen: Apple Music / Spotify

### MoMA Ready The NYC Dance Project Self-released 
> "Take great care with these," MoMA Ready cautions as he introduces his second LP. "They go." With masterful sampling, The NYC Dance Project transforms long played-out classics like First Choice's "Let No Man Put Asunder" and Jeremy Sylvester's "Not a Perfect Love" into raucous new party-rockers. True to its name, The NYC Dance Project teases the ethos of New York's clubs scene from some of house's greatest classics. Listen: Bandcamp / Soundcloud

### Pelada Movimiento Para Cambio PAN 
> House and punk don't often meet. Few people have considered how Marc Kinchen and Joan Jett might sound together. This is one of several unlikely ideas realised on Movimiento Para Cambio. Had the album been purely instrumental, it would still be fantastic—Tobias Rochman's tweaky spins on dembow, breakbeat, experimental pop and '90s house are a joy. Chris Vargas's vocals, however, make this LP exceptional. Whether they sing, bark or rap, one word always comes to mind: "badass." Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Caterina Barbieri Ecstatic Computation Editions Mego 
> How many artists on this list can say they've been called "satanic" and banned from performing by the Catholic Church? You have to admire the irony. According to Caterina Barbieri, her soaring synth music actually sounds best in churches—a fact tragically overlooked by the Portuguese priest who canceled a preview of the Italian's fourth album, Ecstatic Computation. Radiant to the point of being almost overpowering, it's a rush of blissful melodies and trance-inducing arpeggios. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Klein Lifetime ijn inc. 
> Klein compared releasing Lifetime to "giving someone your diary." That this happens to be a mostly wordless album shows how expressive electronic production, and in particular sampling, can be. Lifetime is a ghost-train through Klein's inner world. Its samples (choirs, harmonicas, an overheard argument) are as loaded as they are mysterious, drifting one into the next with rhythms only occasionally rising through the murk. Tommy set expectations high, but Lifetime revealed startling depths to the London artist's sound. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### J Majik Full Circle Infrared 
> Full Circle is as good as any of J Majik's jungle records from the '90s, which means it's flat-out amazing. He was inspired to make it after DJing for RuptureLDN, a crew whose back-to-basics ethos helped him fall in love with the good stuff all over again. The result is one of the best drum & bass albums in recent memory, full of pristine synths, wonderfully worn-out samples and the casual breakbeat brilliance of a jungle master. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Nathan Micay Blue Spring LuckyMe 
> What happens at a renegade rave in cyberspace? This storyline, evoked in cinematic detail, is what drives Nathan Micay's debut album Blue Spring. There are sci-fi synths and mysterious vocal samples, while the beats beneath spiral between dreamy jungle, glittering electro and anthemic trance. Though the album has plenty of emotion and fantasy, best of all are the mega bangers like "The Party We Could Have" that send Blue Spring booming through the galaxy. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Moodymann Sinner KDJ 
> Anyone at Movement Detroit last year might remember a juicy rumour doing the rounds involving Moodymann, barbecued meat and $10 records. Turns out, it was true. The LP being sold out of Kenny Dixon, Jr.'s backyard was Sinner, a slim hodgepodge of new and old music that served as a hearty snack while fans continue to wait for his much-anticipated (and cruelly teased) next album. Ridiculously funky and soulful, with Dixon, Jr. flexing plenty on the mic, Sinner captured the Detroit maverick on exceptional form. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Carla dal Forno Look Up Sharp Kallista Records 
> "DIY is something I stand behind quite firmly," Carla dal Forno said earlier this year. This was already clear through her fledgling label, her dedication to home recording and her skeletal, synth-laced post-punk sound. On her second album, everything felt sharper. The ambient bits hung in the air, the songs, like "So Much Better" and "Took A Long Time," were anthemic. Look Up Sharp feels like a future cult classic, a rallying cry within a modern movement of small-press pop experimentalism. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Maayan Nidam Sea Of Three Perlon 
> Maayan Nidam has been a leader in minimal house for a decade but it took Sea Of Thee to reveal the sound she always envisioned. The result of years of studio research, it infused her spartan but suggestive productions with a new personality and connected with listeners who might otherwise never listen to a Perlon record. It has a muscular sound with a lifelike, breathing quality, but it's Nidam's nimble ideas that make it the label's most fully developed LP in years. Listen: Soundcloud

### Madteo Dropped Out Sunshine DDS 
> As Discogs user rmcc so eloquently put it: "Techno is all straight lines and clean cuts. Madteo draws his impression in marker pen on a dirty napkin. Absolute badman." Dropped Out Sunshine is a case in point. The latest LP from the brilliantly erratic artist is house, hip-hop, techno and downtempo, shredded and smushed into an odd, filthy, pulsing mass no one but him could possibly concoct. This is the sound of a strange and inspired talent running at full tilt. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### 33EMYBW Arthropods SVBKVLT 
> China pushed experimental club music further than almost any other country this year, and Shanghai's 33EMYBW might be the most-forward thinking of them all. Her music is inspired by the scuttling movements, hard exoskeletons and segmented limbs of arthropods—spiders, crustaceans and the like. Arthropods sought to capture their world through startling samples and dazzling rhythms. Club music got weirder and weirder this year, but few records sound as genuinely new as this. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Special Request Vortex Houndstooth 
> When your plan is to release four albums in a year, the first one better be a belter. VORTEX was exactly that, a take-no-prisoners record heaving with outlandish bangers. In terms of club styles, barely a stone was left unturned, with nods to gabber, techno, house, breakbeat and jungle. The whole thing could've ended up a noisy mess were it not for Paul Woolford's exquisite sound design and hard-earned understanding for what makes dance floors boot off. Listen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Soundcloud

## [2018's Best Mixes](https://ra.co/features/3359)
Date: 2018-12-13T14:50:19.000Z

### Yu Su 
> Yu Su Truancy Volume 201 In an infinite pool of online mixes, Truancy Volume 201: Yu Su felt remarkably personal. The Chinese-born, Vancouver-based artist's mix references her classical piano training, the death of her mother and her love of Edward Yang films. In Yu Su's singular world, Liszt's impressionistic piano swells blend seamlessly into Terekke's deep dubs and the motorik optimism of Kraftwerk. The mixing and flow are remarkable. Nathan Micay BIS Radio Show #946 Nathan Micay has long professed a love for trance and progressive house anthems, but few of his sets capture it as well as this radio session, which begins with the euphoric swell of Björk's "Big Time Sensuality," weaves through Paul Oakenfold remixing Smashing Pumpkins and Grooverider reworking The Stone Roses, with newer day-glo productions holding things up in between. If you're dying for an alternate future where '90s excess never ended, this mix is for you. Akua DISCWOMAN 51 Akua is one of many young techno artists who aren't afraid to notch up the tempo, and she's also one of the DJs who does it the best. Full of throttling kick drums, careening synths and thrillingly broken rhythms, Akua makes you feel like you're hurtling through the air at Mach 3. It's a fast and skilled mix worthy of the DJ heroes—Claude Young, Mike Dearborn—that she names in the accompanying interview. CCL HNYPOT 291: Ode To The Queer Steppas On "Ode To The Queer Steppas," their entry in Honey Soundsystem's excellent podcast series, CCL gives us tour through dubstep's strange outer reaches. Weaving together cuts from innovators like T++, Peverelist, Pinch and Shackleton, as well as newer bits from labels like SUED, the mix is balmy, psychedelic and utterly devoid of genre clichés. HNYPOT 291 exemplified that most difficult of DJ tricks: make a familiar style sound utterly different. LSDXOXO FACT Mix 667 LSDXOXO's journey from enterprising hip-hop producer to edit master to no-holds-barred DJ has been exciting to watch. This mix, jumping from old-school house and techno to Baltimore club to ghettotech to hardstyle and lots of subgenres in between, is no less of a rush. It's classic, it's new, it's queer and it's tough, and it's an example of the kind of flair that should help this New Yorker make waves in his new home of Berlin. Avalon Emerson Essential Mix It's not exactly surprising that Avalon Emerson's Essential Mix is good as it is, but you still have to marvel. The mixing is slick, dynamic and bold. The tracklist is full of private edits and upcoming music by talented friends (Aurora Halal, Nathan Micay, Overmono), as well as curveball bits of shoegaze and synth pop. As for that bit with the Soul II Soul acapella played at the wrong speed over a rumbling Paul Woolford track—was there a better moment in any mix this year? re:ni XLR8R Podcast 557 Recorded live at the debut edition of Orbits festival, you can almost feel the sweltering Portuguese heat emanating from re:ni's opening tracks. Everything is built from the same building blocks—precisely layered percussion, unconventional rhythms and airy pads—as the mix builds up from soft dub and trippy chuggers to psychedelic techno. It's a lesson in coaxing mid-afternoon revelers onto the dance floor. Peach DISCWOMAN 55 "I don't think I've been ever very good at the chill thing," Peach admitted when her Discwoman mix was published in October. No matter: her sets happily exist in a space well outside the chill zone. DISCWOMAN 55 was as bright as it was tough, with dreamy breakbeats, 135 BPM rave, the odd dollar-bin oldie and loads of great new music. This was Peach doing what she does best. Ricardo Villalobos Essential Mix What constitutes a good Ricardo set is one of dance music's enduring questions. This one, recorded at Amnesia in Ibiza, has been decried in some quarters for being too commercial. There are some bigger-room tunes in here, not least the Girada Unlimited rework of "Zapatac," but Ricardo's signature tightrope walk between hyper-precision and his famous no-fucks-given attitude is in full effect. And you know from those fader-flicks in the opening stretch that you're in for a treat. Omar MOJ mixes 15 Though currently based in Berlin, Omar comes from Uruguay, a scene where Nicolas Lutz looms large. No surprise then that he'd deliver such a stellar contribution to the podcast series of My Own Jupiter, a "multidisciplinary art platform" run by Lutz and Edurne. A high-energy trip through charismatic techno, electro and house, Omar's mix moves through a range of sounds and moods, strung together with the slick transitions associated with Uruguay's homegrown selectors. Mumdance Shared Meanings If you're the type of person who delights in music that sounds like nothing that came before, Mumdance is your guy. Recorded as a free companion to the compilation he curated, this mix flirts with techno and drum & bass and swerves off the genre map altogether. Featuring tracks from Nkisi, Bambounou and Galaxian, Shared Meanings rounds up some of the most defiantly futuristic club tracks of the year. Kyle Hall and Jay Daniel Live: Fundamentals @ Marble Bar Detroit Despite their international acclaim, Kyle Hall and Jay Daniel are doing it for Detroit. Case in point: their Fundamentals party, a no-frills back-to-back session that's gone down over six years at bars, coffee shops and lofts in the D. This live recording from Marble Bar is a masterclass exploring the intersection of Detroit house, the jazzy '90s Chicago sound, UK broken beat and a whole lot of soul. Slikback Unsound Podcast Slikback's first gig outside East Africa took place in a Kraków basement on a chilly night at this year's Unsound festival. That performance saw the Kenyan artist play an hour of trap, grime and deconstructed club music—all his own music and remixes, including a tune he'd made earlier that day. It was one of the festival's highlights, announcing the arrival of yet another exciting Nyege Nyege talent. Beatrice Dillon FACT Mix 657 Unafraid of pauses, jitters or pivots in direction, Beatrice Dillon showcases her distinctive approach to DJing on this winding mix. She describes it as an hour of "complete tracks and cut up fragments of work by so many different artists," with credit given only to artists and no track titles. Carefully arranging tracks like a jigsaw puzzle, it's the way they interlock and sit together that reveals a bigger picture as the mix unfolds. Mx. Silkman Beyond / Below 10 In less than a year, Hi-Vis's Beyond / Below mix series has established itself as a go-to for ambient mixes, thanks to an open-ended approach that emphasizes both patience and personality. This mix from Cleveland's Mx. Silkman might be the best of them all. It's peaceful with a hint of tension, and underlined with a kosmische-inspired sense of melody. Skee Mask and Zenker Brothers Unsound Podcast Unsound Festival is ostensibly a showcase for music's cutting edge, but it's also earned a reputation for being a superb place to cut loose. Exhibit A: this three-way back-to-back from Skee Mask and Zenker Brothers, recorded early one Sunday morning in Hotel Forum's main room. The range of styles reflects the Ilian Tape sound, but its rowdy energy draws from jungle—from the spinbacks to the volatile, seat-of-your-pants mixing. Yaeji Blowing Up The Workshop 98 There are artists who stand out in their field, and there are artists who are their own field—like Yaeji. Not content to merely play 40 minutes of her favorite music, on Blowing Up The Workshop 98 she adds improvised vocals to create a kind of mix/mixtape hybrid. Yaeji hums, whispers, raps and sings over modern club tracks from the likes of Etch, Chevel and the late DJ Rashad, using her voice and effects to make stylistic jumps feel like natural transitions. Teki Latex The Naked King This guy doesn't call himself the "king of blends" for nothing. The third and final instalment in the French artist's mix trilogy might be the most hilarious and impressive of them all. Squarepusher into Lil' Flip? Sure. Crime Mob's "Knuck If You Buck" over Swedish House Mafia? Why not. Eurythmics into Daft Punk into DJ Deeon? Naturally. Every moment of this mix is so turbo-charged with energy and humour, it's like a roller coaster ride you'll want to go on again and again. Kampire Sounds Of Sónar Kampire set the tone for her standout set at this year's Sónar festival with this Sounds Of Sónar mix, released a couple of months before the main event in Barcelona. It was some calling card from the Kampala DJ, mixing up fresh sounds from Angola, Uganda, Nigeria and the DRC. Full of catchy pop hooks and booming bass, this one showed precisely why Kampire is one of East Africa's leading DJs. John T. Gast UVC Roots & Destruction John T. Gast's enigmatic druid dub creeps quietly out of London with little fanfare, but his fans are cult-like in their devotion to him. This year's instalment of the Roots And Destruction mix series for Bus Editions is more like a solo album than a mixtape, an extension of Gast's private universe that connects dub, knackered electronics and ambient, making heartbreaking paeans with MIDI instruments. Mama Snake & Solid Blake Live: Dekmantel Festival 2018 Apeiron Crew cofounders Mama Snake and Solid Blake are formidable DJs in their own right, but this live recording from Dekmantel shows how phenomenal they are back-to-back. From the brooding electro to the Shepard tones of Ploy's "Garys," through wild cuts of breakbeat, electro, techno and trance, the duo's 90-minute set at Dekmantel's UFO stage is a reminder of the kind of synergy that a back-to-back makes possible. Violet Crack Mix 214 As founder of the record label Naive, cofounder of Rádio Quântica and a string of local parties, Inês Coutinho is a galvanizing force in Lisbon's music scene. She's also a sick DJ, as small clubs and parties around the world are beginning to discover, and as her Crack mix makes clear. Elegantly swerving through one raucous banger after another, never playing the saying type of track twice, Crack 214 shows a gifted DJ having a blast with her records. upsammy BAR Radio #40 When she's not making bangers, Thessa Torsing, AKA upsammy, spends most of her time digging for bleepy curios. She's got a particular penchant for downtempo tracks in the 90 BPM range, a style she explores beautifully on BAR Radio #40. The mix is a slo-mo meander through golden ambient, IDM and other hard-to-define melodic jams. There's even a UK bass track played at the wrong speed. Together, they form one of the year's classiest and most adventurous mixes. object blue Bandcloud Guest Mix The Beijing-born, London-based artist object blue was a producer and live act before she was a DJ, and the way she mixes tracks has the arresting flair of a live performance. Her Bandcloud mix is a good example. Dizzyingly complex but intuitive, blending techno, breaks, experimental club and footwork, she bobs and weaves through angular, futuristic sounds with an ease that reflects her level of technique. Flo Dill SANPO 121 The aesthetic of Australia's Sanpo Disco mix series is leisurely—"Sanpo" is Japanese for "stroll," the series being inspired by its founder's love of long walks. NTS regular Flo Dill got the memo, starting out with some glorious Pat Metheny on ECM, before spending an hour sharing the wistful music that soundtracks her bus commutes around London. DJ Healer Planet Lonely In May, a few weeks after his his double-album release on Easter Sunday, DJ Healer released a free mix through his Soundcloud page called Planet Lonely. Except it isn't really a mix. Moments of silence separate its dozens of tracks, which dip through ambient, downtempo and something like drum & bass, their mellowness offset by themes of self-destruction and apocalypse anxiety. Released as an album, Planet Lonely would have been among the year's biggest records. And yet this oddly understated format seems fitting, if only within the strange logic of this artist's word. DJ Senior Vasquez PARAISOMIX001 You probably know about the Detroit-Berlin connection, but how about the New York-Lisbon connection? New York master Junior Vasquez was a fan of the Portuguese tribal sound of the mid-'90s, and he often played tracks by Portuguese producers at the Sound Factory in Manhattan. DJs like Danny Tenaglia caught on too, and a musical bond formed between the two scenes. Lisbon's Photonz makes this sonic connection audible with this funky, smooth mix of Portuguese house from that era. Nazira Mixmag - Kazakhstan scene The proverbial electronic music map has expanded these last few years, with cities like Kiev, Tbilisi and Montevideo earning overdue recognition. Nazira's January mix for Mixmag turned our attention to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, and her hometown. Capturing the sound of Nazira's ZVUK parties, its big basslines, razor-sharp synths and precision rhythms offer a thrilling glimpse into this small but lively scene. Evan Baggs XLR8R Podcast 530 In the two years between Evan Baggs' RA Podcast and this mix for XLR8R, his focus on an acidic strain of vintage sci-fi techno has tightened. Baggs embodies excellence in this field, and the mix is a sort of mission statement for the vision he's built over the past three or four years alongside artists like Binh and DJ Masda. Without feeling remotely nostalgic, it's a history of dance music's forgotten corners that jolts the present with new energy. Olive T Truancy Volume 205 On first glance, Olive T's Truancy mix feels like it's going to be a smooth ride through deep and melodic house. Then it starts to get more psychedelic, ratcheting up to a rude and heavy breakbeat section before settling back down again. That mid-section explores UK-inspired sounds, but there's something so American about the demeanor of the mix—its confidence, its soul—that reminds you why she's one of the country's up-and-coming DJs. As a bonus, here are ten of our favourite RA mixes from the past 12 months. DJ Bus Replacement Service RA Podcast 610 Doris Woo's RA Podcast, which includes a recording of a North Korean newsreader, an ode to Donald Trump sung by preteens, and a song called "'Roxanne' By The Police But Every Time They Say 'Roxanne' It Gets Faster," shows that her DJ-set-as-stand-up routine isn't just funny—it's downright innovative. Sonido Confirmación An Introduction To The Sonidero Sound The loose and groovy sound of Mexico City's mobile soundsystem parties, mixed by one of scene's key sonideros. Octo Octa RA Live: Sónar, Barcelona The New York artist's jubilant live set from this year’s Sónar festival covers a wider variety of sounds and genres than we’ve heard in her music before. Slipping effortlessly through bouncy breakbeat, shimmering trance and heads-down techno, Octo Octa's music has never felt more vibrant. LilMofo RA Podcast 646 Recorded at Grassroots, one of Tokyo's finest small venues, this full-throttle selection of techno and jungle won Lil Mofo plenty of new fans. Orson Version: RA Label Of The Month Version is known primarily as Germany's preeminent dubstep outpost, but Orson's mix for Label Of The Month shows the impressive scope of their vision. Fusing Version dubplates with old records from rave heroes like Joey Beltram, Frankie Bones and Lenny Dee, the mix exemplifies Orson's knack for time-travelling blends. Sofay RA Live: Brilliant Corners For our RA Live event at Brilliant Corners in March, Sofay travelled down from Glasgow with a bag full of evocative experimental records—perfect for a cosy night in the East London hi-fi bar. Objekt RA Podcast 650 Having successfully conquered tempo, TJ Hertz set his sights on techno's other main structural limitation: kick drums. RA.650 has none of them, and when it breaks through the clouds with Surgeon's all-time classic "Radiance," you'll wonder if techno ever needed them at all. Josey Rebelle Live: Rainbow Disco Club 2018 Close your eyes and picture the scene: you're in a leafy valley with the sun on your back, and Josey Rebelle, one of the world's best DJs, is throwing down party slammers. Sounds pretty great, right? Nightwave RA Podcast 638 62 minutes of rowdy, acid-flecked, neon-tinted party rockers from one of Glasgow's finest. Donato Dozzy Live: Alternate Cuts Donato Dozzy closed last year's Terraforma Festival with a set that bypassed his deep techno sound for half-time drum & bass and gabber. He tried this tempo-spanning, mind-bending approach at Manchester's Soup Kitchen, and the results were similarly spectacular.

### Slikback 
> Slikback Unsound Podcast Slikback's first gig outside East Africa took place in a Kraków basement on a chilly night at this year's Unsound festival. That performance saw the Kenyan artist play an hour of trap, grime and deconstructed club music—all his own music and remixes, including a tune he'd made earlier that day.

### upsammy

## [2018's Best Tracks](https://ra.co/features/3357)
Date: 2018-12-12T13:40:45.000Z

### Eris Drew Hold Me (T4T Embrace Mix) Naive 
> Eris Drew's production debut is as uplifting as her DJ sets. Using a vintage Bob James break, "Hold Me (T4T Embrace Mix)" builds towards a climax, first with its gasping vocal sample, then a synth harpsichord. But instead of tipping over, it stays poised. Like the best raves, it seems to go on and on.

### Kasper Marott Keflavik Seilscheibenpfeiler 
> You'd think it would be too much: thumping kicks, gated snares, an Italo bassline, numerous breakdowns, even the odd bit of electric guitar, and all at 135 BPM. But somehow, all the parts in Kasper Marrot's "Keflavik" work together beautifully, making this ecstatic rush of a track one of the year's best floor-fillers, and a clear breakthrough for the Danish producer.

### Raime Real People, Not Actors Different Circles 
> Raime's take on weightless grime turns their hefty, bass-heavy sound on its head. A flurry of samples—strings, slivers of vocal, barely-there drums—duels with a mallet lead that appears and dissolves in almost random intervals. It's a dizzying four minutes that never sits still, from a duo once known for their hypnotically repetitive, dread-filled grooves.

### Rush Plus Sweat E-Missions 
> How do you make techno that goes hard and fast without feeling suffocating? The Washington, D.C. duo Rush Plus know a thing or two about that. "Sweat" hovers around 140 BPM but never sounds like it, thanks to a swing that soaks up the impact like shock absorbers. Borrowing a trick from '90s classics and updating it for 2018, "Sweat" is face-melting techno that remembers how to be fun.

### Barker Look How Hard I've Tried Ostgut Ton 
> Debiasing might have been 2018's most powerful techno EP, and it didn't even have a kick drum. Barker's melodic masterpiece, his first solo release for Berghain's in-house label, drew from classic techno and trance, channeling the emotional heft of '90s dance music into something distinctly modern. "Look How Hard I've Tried" was its standout moment, a mess of tumbling chords that combine for five minutes of euphoria.

### James Blake If The Car Beside You Moves Ahead Polydor 
> Since 2016, James Blake has inhabited the highest echelons of popular music, collaborating with the likes of Beyoncé, Frank Ocean and Kendrick Lamar. The gangly kid with an angelic voice who started out making weirdo dubstep is now a global star. But has this newfound fame sanitized his sound? Hell no. "If The Car Beside You Moves Ahead," one of two solo tracks released this year, was a strange and spellbinding ride through a world of neon synths and spliced vocals. More than anything, it was proof that great pop need not play by the rules.

### Leif Number 13 TIO-Series 
> Each of Leif's tracks is like a window into another world—a surreal and colorful place drawn out by his rich textures and oddball rhythms. Never was this more true than on "Number 13," a shimmering kaleidoscope of groove and melody that feels both deeply psychedelic and somehow wholesome, like a folk song from another dimension. With each new record, the Welsh producer outdoes himself. This one was no exception.

### Flow Boy Girl Action Tardis 
> The '90s were a great time for UK dance music, especially in the cosmic zone where house and techno intersect. Flow supplied some of that era's most sought-after tech house tunes, many of which are still played by dance music's classiest DJs. This 11-minute wrecking ball was an unreleased tune from that era, given new life by Eli Verveine and Oscar Schubaq's Tardis label. It steamrolled dance floors all over the world in 2018.

### Peggy Gou It Makes You Forget (Itgehane) Ninja Tune 
> If it was anyone's year, it was Peggy Gou's. The South Korean artist made mincemeat of the international club and festival scene, DJing around 150 gigs. This was made possible in part by her Ninja Tune debut, which immediately felt like a classic. The hand percussion, rubbery bassline and heavy-lidded vocal of "It Makes You Forget (Itgehane)" hit on a breezy, Sade-via-Larry Heard romanticism.

### 700 Bliss Cosmic Slop Halcyon Veil 
> When Moor Mother and DJ Haram teamed for an EP this year, it was clearly the start of something big. Pairing Moor Mother's hardcore doom poetry with Haram's scarily tense instrumentals, Spa 700 gives shape to the anger and alienation of being poor and black in America. "Cosmic Slop," the highlight from that EP, is like getting grabbed and shaken by the shoulders, and that's not just because of the sub-bass.

### DJ Koze Pick Up (12" Extended Disco Version) Pampa 
> "The most beauty is between melancholic and euphoric," DJ Koze tells us. "I think 'Pick Up' has some of both, a counterbalance of the sad voice and the disco loop, which could last forever. I like the simplicity, that there are so few elements. The brain has time and space to imagine and think on its own, which is something I loved about hip-hop. You find one loop, and if it's magical, you can hear it forever. But they're not easy to find. It's the only track I've made in one night—in three or four hours, with a bottle of red wine. So it's the song that took me the least work, but had the biggest impact."

### Krystal Klear Neutron Dance Running Back 
> When Gerd Janson dropped "Neutron Dance" at Sugar Mountain, a month before it came out, there were various, outsized reactions. Immediate whooping. Ear-to-ear grins. In-unison jumping. The track would continue to get these reactions all summer. The New York-via-Dublin producer's new wave house cut was a hit because it triggered multiple levels of nostalgia, riffing on both New Order's "Bizarre Love Triangle" and Todd Terje's arpeggiated ecstasy.

### Donato Dozzy Cleo Eerie Records 
> Here's what Marco Shuttle told Donato Dozzy after he dropped "Cleo" in a DJ set: "Donato, I don't think you quite realise what you have done. This stuff is just something else, it's beyond… the people are just melting when I play it!" Anyone who's heard "Cleo" in the past year will understand what he meant. Its wafting lead feels angelic and profound. Its 16th-note arps cast you into high tides of bliss. The deep techno scene to which Dozzy belongs rarely produces anthems, but in "Cleo," it certainly has.

### DJ Call Me Marry Me Highlife 
> "When a taxi would pass playing this song to the max volume, while we are in class.... errbody would sing stand up and dance." So said one YouTube user about DJ Call Me's "Marry Me," a kwaito hit reissued this year by the Scottish label Highlife, a decade after it took South Africa by storm. Sickly sweet and maddeningly catchy, its bubbly spirit drew smiles from dancers around the world.

### Ploy Ramos Timedance 
> Remember the days of UK bass anthems like "Footcrab" and "Swims"? When dancers used to jump up and scream when they recognized the familiar notes of an incoming track? Well, this bare-bones beat science bomb may bring that phenomenon back. It's instantly recognizable despite being almost entirely percussion, and it makes powerful but tasteful use of the drop, deadly effective in rooms big and small.

### Marie Davidson Work It Ninja Tune 
> On "Work It," Marie Davidson is your motivational speaker. "Now, I don't wanna see any fake-ass workers / I need real builders." Neither the assembly line rhythms nor Davidson's charming voice will let you clock out now. A standout from Davidson's Working Class Woman, "Work it" sounds like a health goth SoulCycle anthem for the late capitalism era—in the best possible way.

### Gila 106 Slipper Hunnaban Inc. 
> Let's imagine you're a DJ with a lot of acid records—so many, in fact, that you reckon you've heard all the good ones, and whatever's out now sounds like it's all been done before. If that sounds like you, then trust us: Gila's "106 Slipper" is still essential stuff. It's at a tempo—106 BPM—that isn't all that common for 303 tracks, for a start. The acid line—actually more of a smudge—growls high in the mix, with an echo effect that screams "warehouse." At key points, the frenzied percussion rolls on and on, as though certain the next track will crank the pressure right up.

### object blue Act Like It Then Tobago Tracks 
> Object Blue released two excellent EPs this year. "Act Like It Then," from her debut release, is teasingly antagonistic, and samples Cardi B, one of the year's most commanding personalities. Rattling percussion amps up the chaos until a vocal line, spoken in Mandarin, briefly slows everything down for a moment of introspection.

### Overmono Daisy Chain Poly Kicks 
> If your ingredients are good, why muddle your flavors with a complicated recipe? That's the lesson we learn from this sternum-shaking breakbeat bomb, which sees Truss and Tessela deliver a seven-minute masterclass in simplicity. The pacing here is worth noting too—it's invigorating when that bass comes back in at the perfect moment after the breakdown.

### Pangaea Bone Sucka Hessle Audio 
> “Bone Sucka” is the textbook definition of a "weird banger." It's got bass, breaks and laser-beam rave synths, but there's a quirkiness to everything that makes it both slightly silly and incredibly memorable. That also makes it classic Hessle Audio, balancing a love of novelty and a sense of humor with enough raw power to flatten the dance floor.

### upsammy Another Place Nous'klaer Audio 
> "Will still be good in 3018," wrote one RA commenter about Another Place, the debut EP from De School resident upsammy. This timeless quality felt particularly pronounced on the title track, a breakbeat bomb so steely and atmospheric it could have come out of The Hague 20 years ago. That it was made in 2018 by a 21-year-old is proof of upsammy's talent.

### OCB Aquaquest Pt.2 (The Anticlimax) Casa Voyager 
> Morocco's Casa Voyager label, named after a train station in Casablanca, had a breakout year. Among the high-energy techno and funk-laden grooves, there was OCB's "Aquaquest Pt. 2 (The Anticlimax)," an emotional blend of acid, electro and house. This touching brand of dance music is Casa Voyager's specialty, and no track showcased it better than "Aquaquest Pt. 2 (The Anticlimax)."

### Joy O Seed Hinge Finger 
> For a few years, Joy Orbison didn't make tracks, he made anthems. His hit rate has slowed down—he last featured in our top tracks list in 2013—but don't let the lack of big hooks and hands-in-the-air moments put you off: the South Londoner is currently making some of the best music of his career. "Seed," the opener on this year's brilliant 81b EP, is a shining example, a screwface banger with a rude rhythmic core.

### Aphex Twin T69 Collapse Warp Records 
> Soon doctors may start diagnosing electronic music fans with a strange new condition: "Aphex Twin fatigue." The blimps, the posters, the cryptic maps—it's all getting a bit much, right? Well, the thing is, the music still absolutely bangs. As long as Richard D. James keeps putting out records like this year's Collapse EP, it's hard to stay annoyed at him for long. That record's standout was "T69 Collapse," a rollercoaster ride of fits and starts, squalls and squeals, that, like all great Aphex Twin tracks, left you open-mouthed and scratching your head.

### Shackleton Wakefulness And Obsession Woe To The Septic Heart 
> Following welcome detours with Vengeance Tenfold and Anika, Shackleton returned to his trademark sound on Furnace Of Guts. Signature Shackleton-isms abound, as Euclidean rhythms send non-Western drums refracting down a hall of digital mirrors. Synthetic synths twist into hypothetical instruments of extinct cultures. "Wakefulness And Obsession" also boasts the most straight-up drop we've heard from Shackleton in some time, a profoundly deep prospect for the dance.

### Abby Echiverri Nadezhda The Bunker New York 
> If her debut release, Ab Initio, was any indication, Abby Echiverri's far-reaching pedigree in music and audio has equipped her with a powerful set of tools. It all comes together on "Nadezhda," an electro nightstalker that builds with a canny sleight-of-hand. Despite being staunchly retro-futuristic in its sound, the complete package feels modern and self-assured, combining the immediacy of a performed take with considered flourishes like a grainy answering machine recording and glittering Gameboy supernovas.

### Batu Flash React XL Recordings 
> Slowed-down footwork or sped-up Bristol techno? "Flash React" is hard to pin down, but its mystery is central to its appeal. The acoustic-tinged drums have the focus of a percussion ensemble, offering minimalistic pitter-patter whose light touch signals an impending blow. When the punch lands, it's a quick and efficient jab shadowed by snatches of dissonance, recalling the paranoid urban landscapes of late '90s drum & bass. This half-imagined connection is aided by the occasional repitching of the sub, which gently signals to dubwise jungle. Yet much of the tonal content is surprisingly cheery, its light-heartedness forcing us yet again to reconsider just what the hell this tune is.

### rRoxymore Mythical Technology Don't Be Afraid 
> rRoxymore has always had a peculiar bent, but "Mythical Technology" is a particularly enticing concoction, mixing found-sound ambience and IDM-ready quirks with a playful melody. The cherry on the cake is the shift to a four-on-the-floor kick in the middle third, paired with a sub-line that wouldn't be out of place in a half-time jungle tune.

### Peach Silky Intergraded 
> It's sometime after 5 AM on a busy dance floor. The night's been bubbling along nicely, but you and your friends are beginning to tire. A Sunday morning in bed seems more appealing by the minute. In this scenario, there are only a few tracks that a DJ could play to keep you on the dance floor. "Silky," by Peach, is one of them. Its diva vocal coos and mysterious synth tones are big, crowdpleasing gestures. But two specific details give "Silky" an added depth: a pinging rubber-band pulse, which gives the beat a kind of strutting confidence, and strings that seem to tap dance with joy.

### DJ Lilocox Fronteiras Príncipe 
> The common theme of DJ Lilocox's first full record was rhythm. It's something the Portuguese artist and his Príncipe peers do exceedingly well, and much of Paz & Amor's appeal lay in its nuanced batida drum patterns. But on "Fronteiras," Lilocox added considerable emotional weight, with gentle chords that summoned an evocative late-night mood.

### LSDXOXO Burn The Witch 
> After LSDXOXO self-released his BODY MODS mixtape in January, the tracks appeared in club sets all year. "Burn The Witch," which samples the jazzy interlude on Missy Elliott's "I'm Really Hot," is the smoothest of the bunch, with hard drums, sexed-up vocals and slippery rhythms. Few tracks this year had so much attitude.

### SOPHIE Immaterial Transgressive Records 
> SOPHIE's debut album revamped pop music with wildly imaginative sound design. Of all its electric moments, "Immaterial" sits on top. It's a one-of-a-kind pop anthem, with sugary vocals, a chord progression that makes your serotonin rush—and lyrics that muse on the fluidness of identity. This is SOPHIE having blissful and silly fun.

### Bruce What Hessle Audio 
> Though he's also good at more exploratory tracks, Bruce's bangers are his trump card. The Bristolian's debut album gave him space to explore the extremes of his sound, with "What" ranking as his most intense dance floor production since "Not Stochastic." It keeps its cards close to its chest until a woman's voice is granulated into frozen sheets of shattering ice, which ratchets up the tension. And when he does push the red button a third of the way in, it's the vaguely Eastern tonality of the lead line that gives "What" its madcap intensity.

### Joy O & Ben Vince Transition 2 Hessle Audio 
> If the words "Joy O on Hessle Audio" call anything to mind, it's probably not psychedelic microhouse with saxophone on top. But that's what you get on "Transition 2," a sunny, offbeat, undulating groover with tripping saxophone from the artist Ben Vince. That something that sounds so odd should sound so perfectly natural on record shows how, over a decade into their respective catalogs, neither artist nor label have lost their edge.

### Daniel Avery Quick Eternity (Four Tet Remix) Phantasy Sound 
> Four Tet's 2018 remix credits include high-profile efforts for Bicep and the Norwegian pop singer Sigrid, but nothing captured his sound like his rework for Daniel Avery. First appearing as an exclusive 12-inch sold at London's Field Day festival in June, its official release a few weeks later brought its charm to a wider audience, revealing an intricate and detailed tune that moved from shimmering garage to mangled techno over nine spellbinding minutes.

### Schacke Automated Lover Kulør 
> Last month we called Kulør 001—the first release on Courtesy's new label—"an excellent primer on Copenhagen's fast techno scene," which nods to the city's trance era three decades prior. The compilation's highlight, "Automated Lover" by Schacke, is crunchy and dark, until labyrinthine synths wind through the atmosphere to create something as heavy as it is weightless.

### Donato Dozzy Nine-O'-Three Tresor 
> Donato Dozzy's 2018 wasn't just about lulling dance floors into a trance with "Cleo." He also cooked up this pounding club track, unleashing an unnervingly aggressive side to his sound. The combined force of the compressed 303 and untamed kick drum create a determined menace—industrial strength acid ready to dissolve everything in its path.

### Djrum Sex R&S Records 
> On this year's album, Portrait With Firewood, Djrum recorded live instruments for the first time. The results were cinematic and emotionally rich, with cello, piano and vocal parts decorating his glossy drum & bass and techno tracks. "Sex," the LP's lead single, begins as effective but straightforward electro. Its dense string arrangements, revealed halfway through, made for unexpectedly poignant moments on the dance floor.

### uon J West Mineral Ltd. 
> By definition, ambient music doesn't stand out. And it tends not to make lists like this. It's apt, then, that "J" wasn't so much a standout as something to sink into. Its dub techno pulse gave it a tidal motion, while silky tones gave it an immersive, goo-like consistency. If that all drew you into "J"'s depths, other details conveyed rippling surfaces and distant landmarks—you were adrift, but not far out enough to feel unsafe.

### Fatima Caught In A Lie Eglo 
> Four long years after Yellow Memories, Fatima returned, fired up and wiser, with And Yet It's All Love, a beautiful album shot through with musings on hope, sorrow and personal growth. RA's Max Pearl called it "complex yet catchy," a tag that rang particularly true on the LP's second single, "Caught In A Lie." Strapping Fatima's shapeshifting flow to a lithe and earthy Natureboy Flako beat, this one struck straight for the heart, an example of modern R&B at its best.

### Róisín Murphy Plaything The Vinyl Factory 
> When Roisin Murphy and Maurice Fulton announced their four-EP collaboration earlier this year, it sounded like an ideal partnership: a vital pop artist and a master of disco-funk anthems. The results exceeded expectations. All eight tracks were exceptional, but "Plaything" was the most resonant. Though it nodded to Murphy's own music industry hassles, the track's theme of resilience, and the rousing funk keys that accompany it, had an effortless immediacy. "Plaything" drew from personal experience to express something universal, the mark of any compelling club or pop record.

### Beta Librae Problem Solving Program Allergy Season 
> "Problem Solving Program" is a standout in a banner year for Beta Librae. What makes this one so good? It might be the the scuffed textures, the jungle-inflected rhythms, the dizzying dual tempo of 90 / 180 BPM. Along with her Sanguine Bond LP from May, "Problem Solving Program" highlights Beta Librae as one of New York's most promising young artists.

### Blawan Tasser TERNESC 
> There's two ways you can dance to Blawan's "Tasser," the standout track from 2018's biggest techno album. You can follow the straight-ahead tenacious drum pattern in a routine one-two step motion. Alternatively, you might embrace the peek-a-boo synth line in a fragmented twisting arm dance as it zig-zags through the track. However you move to it, this is a rare kind of fearsome club banger—one that retains a jester's sense of fun.

### Sinjin Hawke & Zora Jones God Planet Mu 
> Sinjin Hawke & Zora Jones bend genres into futuristic shapes in the same way that their label, Fractal Fantasy, uses video to contort 3D visuals into dazzling forms. "God" is a prime example. The drums are somewhere between UK funky and reggaeton, the eerie vocals lifted from a recording of a Bulgarian choir. It's a melting pot where you can't quite pick out what the original ingredients were, and it's about as innovative as club music gets.

### Special Request Brainstorm (Gerd Janson & Shan Remix) Houndstooth 
> A great remix often identifies and amplifies a pivotal element from the original. Gerd Janson and Shan have already teamed up on a few big tracks, like 2017's "Surrender." On their "House Mix" of "Brainstorm," they embraced their inner Murk, crafting a peak-time house tune out of Paul Woolford's original. This version spotlights the original's cascade of pianos and Kerri Chandler-produced diva vocal, more than earning the spinbacks scattered throughout.

### Talaboman Dins El Llit (Superpitcher Remix) R&S Records 
> Superpitcher's shamanic sound was a perfect match for Talaboman's "Dins El Llit," a deep and spacey tune from last year's The Night Land. Over 11 minutes, melodies unfurl underneath vocals that bounce around the stereo field, burrowing deeper into your brain with every bar. Somewhere between heads-down hypnotism and goofy fun, this was among the year's most immersive remixes.

### Alva Noto Uni Blue Noton 
> This year saw the Noton boss recontextualising his glitched-out sound design within more emotive forms. "Uni Blue" is the best example. With the forlorn drama of the final scene in a Hollywood sci-fi, grandiose, smouldering synths bleed into an infinite horizon as the distinctive percussion contrasts against a vast backdrop, creating a breathtaking sense of scale.

### Nathan Micay First Casualty Whities 
> You can tell Nathan Micay has a cheeky sense of humor—he played Smashing Pumpkins on Beats In Space, and keeps a dub mix of "Macarena" on his USB at all times. But there's a sensitive side to Micay as well, which he revealed on "First Casualty," a big-room club track shot through with a bittersweet sense of optimism. Rolling, sonorous, widescreen and hi-def, this was the year's choice track for misty-eyed sunrises.

### Nkisi Darknoise Arcola 
> One of the year's most terrifying and exhilarating tracks, "Darknoise" plants the mosh-pit mob mentality of darkside hardcore within an isolationist dystopia, leaving space for harmonies conjuring feelings of bottomless sadness. Excruciatingly brief, it condenses more power into a few minutes than most producers manage in a lifetime.

### Laurel Halo Raw Silk Uncut Wood Latency 
> From one record to the next, Laurel Halo makes staggering stylistic leaps—by now, they're connected not by how they sound, but by how they feel. And feel, specifically texture, is what "Raw Silk Uncut Wood" is all about. Synthetic horns and organ enmesh, flowing from optimism to elegy, before Oliver Coates' cello lends a sense of finality. Somehow, this ambient piece radiates the same anodyne longing as her pop and club experiments.

## [2018's Best Albums](https://ra.co/features/3384)
Date: 2018-12-11T12:20:39.000Z

### Autechre NTS Sessions 1-4 Warp Records 
> Autechre's NTS Sessions is the most convincing piece of world-building in music today. Its universe is one whose causal networks are as beautifully balanced and interconnected as our own. Released as a four-part series on NTS and comprising around eight hours of music (culminating in an hour-long track, "all end"), this is a magnum opus from one of electronic music's most influential acts, and proof that, in the quarter century they've been making music, Rob Brown and Sean Booth have never stopped moving forward. Listen / NTS / Session 1 / Session 2 / Session 3 / Session 4

### Julia Holter Aviary Domino 
> It's easy to get wrapped up in the intense, loud moments of Aviary, when atonal chords clash or Julia Holter's voice soars over her orchestra playing at forte. But it's the quiet moments in this 90-minute, cinematic masterwork that are most affecting and lasting, the meditative spaces between the overwhelming outbursts. The droning organ on "Another Dream," the sweet strings of "Words I Heard," and the gentle piano carrying "In Garden Muteness" are shelter when the rest of the world sounds like "Everyday Is An Emergency." Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Fatima And Yet It's All Love Eglo 
> How do you follow a game-changing debut album like Yellow Memories? Well, here's proof that you don't need to drastically reinvent yourself—you just have to keep honing your artistry. While Fatima's debut LP wowed with its non-conformist approach to modern soul, its successor lands on a modest and mature sound that's just as captivating. The understated songwriting allows her voice to shine in a way that it didn't on Yellow Memories, so what we get here is Fatima at her most organic. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### Leon Vynehall Nothing Is Still Ninja Tune 
> Leon Vynehall's Nothing Is Still feels like much more than an album. It is a fully formed project, a creative vision realised, with a suite of tracks supplemented by a novella and a series of videos, all inspired by the artist's grandparents' emigration from the UK to New York City in the 1960s. A narrative of sadness and hope, evoking images of giant ships and foggy oceans, Nothing Is Still was one of the year's richest concept albums—not bad for someone who made his name with feel-good house tunes. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Lucrecia Dalt Anticlines Rvng Intl. 
> In 2018 Lucrecia Dalt found a happy home on RVNG Intl., a record label with a decade-plus history of releasing experimental artists like Holly Herndon, Julia Holter and Visible Cloaks. On Anticlines, Dalt proved she had just as much to say as RVNG's best-known alumni. The album, a combination of modular synth sound design and Dalt's spoken-word vocals, sought inspiration from a variety of sources, from her career as a geotechnical engineer to El Boraro, a mythical Colombian creature who drinks its victims' insides through a hole in their head. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Various 15 Years Of The Bunker The Bunker New York 
> More than just a label and a party, The Bunker New York is a sprawling techno family, built around a core of US artists but reaching all around the world. You see this in 15 Years Of The Bunker, which connects Bunker residents (Derek Plaslaiko, Mike Servito) with old friends (Leisure Muffin, Ectomorph) and new ones (Gunnar Haslam, Abby Echiverri) plus a few artists from abroad (Wata Igarashi, Neel, Tobias.). Everyone in this sprawling cast delivers something close to their A-game. The result is a strikingly fresh and eclectic collection that shows a techno institution in rude health. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Varg Nordic Flora Series Pt. 5: Crush Posh Isolation 
> Crush is the most theatrical chapter yet of Jonas Rönnberg's epic Nordic Flora Series. Here, the Swedish artist conveys the feeling of falling in love through Dadaist slam poetry, hazy dream pop, barreling techno and off-kilter broken beat tracks, all wrapped in the gauzy layers of atmosphere that have become his trademark. It's a crowded sea of contradictions that reflects the artist who made it: absurd one moment, heart-rending the next, and, most of the time, brilliant. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Sarah Davachi Gave In Rest Ba Da Bing! 
> Sarah Davachi made her new LP during periods of rest amidst a hectic touring schedule. This gives it a sense of purpose: drone as meditation. She found solace in unlikely places—"not creating a sacred space, but imitating the sense of space in sacred buildings from a secular perspective," she said in an interview with Bandcamp. The minimalist compositions on Gave In Rest have a powerful sense of setting, whether that's a massive cathedral or the corner of a hotel room. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Various Don't Mess With Cupid, 'Cause Cupid Ain't Stupid Trip 
> 20 releases in, Nina Kraviz's Trip label remains an essential source for mind-melting techno. Don't Mess With Cupid, 'Cause Cupid Ain't Stupid is one of Trip's most extreme efforts yet, inspired by gabber and hardcore and featuring an obscure Aphex Twin project alongside a cast of young guns. These tracks are hard, fast and relentless, but they're also creative, experimental, even soulful—exactly the type of strange magic that's always made Kraviz and her label great. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Honey Robyn Island Records 
> Robyn has always turned sadness into anthemic pop, but on Honey, we hear the process in real time. Over the course of her most revealing album, the Swedish artist deals with death and heartbreak, and comes out on top thanks in part to the power of music itself. Robyn has called the LP a "diary in grief," but to the listener it has the opposite effect: an uplifting album that triumphs in the face of loss. Listen / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### serpentwithfeet soil Secretly Canadian 
> On his debut album, Josiah Wise reins in the drama of his earlier work and channels his yearning into songs inspired by gospel, one of his earliest loves. It helps that he has one of the most powerful voices in electronic music, and that his co-producers (Katie Gately, Clams Casino and more) know how to handle it, creating barely-there beds of sound to let Wise sing about obsession, longing and self-hatred. soil balances its musical restraint with an outpouring of feeling so honest and exposed that it's almost uncomfortable—and gripping all the way through. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Christoph De Babalon If You're Into It, I'm Out Of It Cross Fade Enter Tainment 
> This year's repress of If You're Into It, I'm Out Of It wasn't an act of retromania. Despite originally arriving 21 years ago, the re-release resonated with today's audience such that it seemed to have come out two decades early. The traditional idea of "timeless" music smacks of an era in thrall to nostalgia, but If You're Into It… is about as close as we'll get to the genuine article. It builds a world where violence and sadness are double-helixed with hope and an irrepressible energy, a powerful paradox that's only become more potent with the passage of time. Listen / Apple Music / Spotify

### Demdike Stare Passion Modern Love 
> Demdike Stare's knack for turning rubble into gold was on full display this year. Passion had us picturing the Mancunians crisping their samplers over an open flame, creating a charred patina that highlights the record as artefact—released today, ancient tomorrow. They threw time and culture in the blender, too, forging connections between styles that make no chronological sense but work within their own strange logic. There's theory to pry apart if you wish, but Passion is nothing if not fun, positioning Demdike as equal parts alchemists, archaeologists and B-boys. Listen / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Anthony Naples Take Me With You Good Morning Tapes 
> Take Me With You was originally meant to be a mixtape for Anthony Naples' friends, inspired by their afterhours hangs. It ended up being closer to a proper album, and possibly his loveliest record yet. The personal element helps explain its warmth: this is dubbed-out ambient music that glows with a sense of deep comfort, instilling relaxation as well as the energy to keep on hanging out. It's easy to listen to, but it's far from easy listening, teasing out the melodic gift that Naples has shown since his very first track and making it the focal point. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Jlin Autobiography Planet Mu 
> Jlin is the only artist to appear in RA's best albums list in both 2017 and 2018. Last year it was Black Origami; this year it's Autobiography, a project that united the worlds of ballet and experimental electronics. The album burst into life when presented in the way it was intended: as a score for lithe dancers in a contemporary dance production choreographed by Wayne McGregor. As an LP, it has a more subtle power. Moments of serene ambience live side by side with nail-hard claps and kicks, reflecting the ballet's balance of elegance and grit. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Silvia Kastel Air Lows Blackest Ever Black 
> Air Lows is a tale of two albums. The first reflected Kastel's roots in scuzzy avant-DIY scenes, which is the very reason it was scrapped—it sounded like a Silvia Kastel album. The second and final version of Air Lows was more of a shock, presenting a world of soft hues and smooth surfaces that feels straight out of Studio Ghibli, which the listener seems to observe from the comfort of a slow-moving cloud. The choice to abandon the safety of darkness to embrace colour and clarity was a bold move for an artist given her biggest platform to date. The result is an album of compelling poise. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Martyn Voids Ostgut Ton 
> It's easy to feel nostalgic about dubstep's golden era and the transformative years that followed. When it shifted from a local subculture to a diffuse, fragmented influence on the electronic music world, Martyn was one of the producers leading the pack. In his releases from '08 and '09 in particular, he rendered the genre's rude drums and heavy basslines with an unusual elegance, creating a hybrid template many producers would later imitate. Voids channels the spirit of those records, and of a time when the collisions and seepages between genres made music especially fresh. Tracks like "Manchester," "Mind Rain" and "Nya" will scratch your itch for that post-dubstep sound while presenting something wholly modern. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Pendant Make Me Know You Sweet West Mineral Ltd. 
> Brian Leeds, the artist also known as Huerco S and Pendant, is proving to be one of electronic music's more pleasantly contrarian characters, always stepping sideways as soon as you get the hang of him. Let Me Know You Sweet is no exception. Moving on from the soothing qualities of the acclaimed For Those Of You Who Have Never (And Also Those Who Have), his album as Pendant takes a creepier tack. This isn't ambient music for your listening bar. It's textural drone to make you look over your shoulder on your walk home. Listen / Bandcamp

### Yves Tumor Safe In The Hands Of Love Warp Records 
> Yves Tumor, real name Sean Bowie, clearly likes messing with people's expectations. One minute he's releasing tender guitar music, the next he's screaming the house down at a live show. His latest left turn was Safe In The Hands Of Love, a record delivered straight from the heart, introducing us to Bowie the songwriter. With radio-friendly gems like "Noid" and "Licking An Orchid," Safe In The Hands Of Love warmly blurred the lines between experimental music and pop. Listen / Apple Music / Spotify

### Surgeon Luminosity Device Dynamic Tension 
> In a year that saw Surgeon return to DJing regularly, self-release a digital-only album of drone and ambient, and perform as Little Baby Cheeses with DJ Bus Replacement Service, the release of his eighth studio album marked another triumph in his continued evolution as an artist. Emblematic of the mood of techno in 2018, trancey arps and soaring synths flicker above driving club tracks. Taking inspiration from a Buddhist text describing the liminal space between death and rebirth, this is techno imbued with a restless energy. The result strikes an impressive balance between unsettled emotions and ferocious rhythms. Listen / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Grouper Grid Of Points Kranky 
> Recorded during a short residency in Northern Wyoming, Grid Of Points feels at one with the land. The spare, 22-minute album of piano songs seems to internalize the opposing forces within nature and ourselves. Liz Harris harmonizes beautifully with herself on songs like "The Races" and "Parking Lot," crafting hymns to the everyday. On "Birthday Song," she sings: "This emotional disturbance began / When I could not get the door open / I wailed and turned into a demon." Light and darkness, harmony and chaos, a coal train cutting across the expanse. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### DJ Healer Prime Minister Of Doom Nothing 2 Loose + Mudshadow Propaganda All Possible Worlds 
> Are these the final records from DJ Healer / Prime Minister Of Doom / Traumprinz / DJ Metatron / Prince Of Denmark? The Hollywood Forever cemetery on the homepage, the Shakespeare quotes on the sleeve, the three-hour SoundCloud dump that came a few weeks later—Nothing 2 Loose and Mudshadow Propoganda had an air of farewell from artist we never really met. True or not, this speaks to the drama and mystery that have always haunted his music, and which reached new heights on these twin albums, one sparse and elegiac, the other lean and thumping, whose release on Easter Sunday was one of the biggest events in electronic music this year.

### Marie Davidson Working Class Woman Ninja Tune 
> "You wanna know how I get away with everything?" Marie Davidson sneers on Working Class Woman. "I work all the fucking time." The Montreal artist's latest album casts a sardonic eye on the toil at the heart of 24-hour party culture, but her freakish dedication is already clear from the music itself. Working Class Woman sees Davidson marshaling all sides of her sound—synth pop, acid, noisy experimentation—into a singular pop statement. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### De Leon De Leon Mana 
> Are the gamelan-inspired polyrhythms of De Leon's first album the result of live performance or studio trickery? Maybe a combination of both? It's impossible to say—the act is careful not to reveal too much about itself. What we do know is that De Leon comes from the US collective Aught, and that their self-titled LP, released on experimental London label Mana, was the best thing they've done so far: an exhilarating mixture of flutes, bell tones and ever-shifting drum patterns. Listen / Bandcamp / Soundcloud

### Blawan Wet Will Always Dry TERNESC 
> Within his first few records, released across 2010 and 2011, Jamie Roberts delivered what most techno artists seek their whole careers: an instantly recognisable sound. This sound reached maturity on his debut album. Wet Will Always Dry is a collection of stunning modular workouts, its sound design rich and detailed, with layers of zapping synths interwoven into growling basslines and spectral vocals. Some tracks ("Tasser," "Vented") were best heard on the dance floor. Others ("Careless," "Stell") provided more intimate thrills. Combined, they made for a near-flawless techno LP. Listen / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### SOPHIE Oil Of Every Pearl's Un-Insides Transgressive Records 
> You could tell from SOPHIE's singles she was more than just a producer. Her debut album, the mystifyingly titled Oil Of Every Pearl's Un-Insides, confirmed this. Its nine tracks more radically defy convention than perhaps anything else that came out this year, not least in their marriage of pop and experimental sounds. In its lyrics, cover art and music videos, the album went a step further, riffing on subjects large and small (from gender to JUULs) and making SOPHIE herself its dazzling centerpiece. No longer just a brilliant producer, with Oil Of Every Pearl's Un-Insides, SOPHIE became a star. Listen / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Hunee Hunchin' All Night Rush Hour Music 
> Hunee's ascent to DJ stardom is thanks in part to his way of making graceful leaps from one sound to another during his sets. Hunchin' All Night, a compilation for Rush Hour Music that was at least two years in the making, provided a glimpse into the collection of a DJ who's become one of the scene's foremost tastemakers. Next to the dreamy, flute-led experimentation of "Blu Terra" by Carlos Maria Trindade and Nuno Canavarro (a song Hunee regularly airs in the early moments of his sets) there was quality US house and techno plus music by artists from Senegal, Ghana and South Africa. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### DJ Koze Knock Knock Pampa 
> DJ Koze is one of electronic music's most intriguing personalities: an insomniac who sleeps till late afternoon most days, an introvert who downs champagne straight from the bottle onstage, but whose tracks have an uncanny ability to sound carefree one minute and heartbroken the next. Knock Knock was another glance into his strange world. A push-and-pull between melancholy and bliss—captured best on its hit single, "Pick Up"—this delightful album was another step forward for one of house music's most accomplished producers. Listen / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Tirzah Devotion Domino 
> Hooks are the building blocks of pop music. They're often engineered for maximum stickiness, boiled down to simple melodies and clean contours. On Devotion, the debut album from British singer-songwriter Tirzah, we get catchy, irresistible pop music that's also delightfully disheveled. Producer Mica Levi shines without stealing the spotlight, balancing ultra-minimalist piano ballads like "Affection" with quietly weird dance floor bombs like "Holding On." The result is an endearing collection of impressionistic love songs that reveal new complexities with every listen. Listen / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Shinichi Atobe Heat DDS 
> Few people know much about Shinichi Atobe. Until a photo of him DJing surfaced last year, some may have doubted he was even a real person. But the appetite for the Japanese artist's high-definition, Basic Channel-schooled techno has far outstripped curiosity about his personal life. Since ending a 13-year hiatus with 2014's Butterfly Effect, he has been extraordinarily consistent. But in giving his sound an extra dimension—as heard in the poolside UK garage of "So Good, So Right" and the DJ Sprinkles-evoking "Heat 1"—Atobe may have made his best record yet. Listen / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Specter Built To Last Sound Signature 
> Specter's Built To Last took a few years to make, but the music within reflected nearly two decades of craft. Andres Ordonez began making club-ready house tracks in 2001 with Damon Lamar on their Tetrode label, establishing a "deep jack" style we still hear in his music today. But Built To Last, his debut album, is defined by stranger, more mesmerising sounds. Take "0829 Fifty Fifty," where a sure-footed house groove is festooned with odd samples, from a sweeping broom to what sounds like a haunted water fountain. This depth of imagination made for one of 2018's most essential house LPs. Listen / Soundcloud

### Objekt Cocoon Crush PAN 
> These days, techno's vision of the future can sometimes seem out of date. TJ Hertz's second album as Objekt, though, presents one that feels both unnerving and all too tangible. Take the holographic Fourth World of "Lost & Found (Lost Mix)," or "Rest Yr Troubles Over Me," a ballad for an AI assassin. Hertz also updated his own sound by adding a bacterial life to his ultra-precise production. The LP's fierce originality is matched by its disarming tenderness. Even in Hertz's impressive catalogue, Cocoon Crush is a highlight. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Borusiade A Body Cómeme 
> It's usually a good sign when you struggle to define an artist's sound. Borusiade's music is especially slippery. Some may hear hints of gloomy '80s genres in her dance records; the Romanian artist points to Baroque music as a key influence. (She used to sing in a national children's choir.) A Body enhanced her music's air of supernatural mystery. The LP's deeply evocative tracks are held together by immaculate layers of melody and harmony, showing an uncommon musicality. It comes together best on "Breathe," a gothic drama where her smoky monotone gives it all an irresistible pull. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### JK Flesh New Horizon Electric Deluxe 
> "As a 19 or 20-year-old, I used to fantasize that one day I [would] master this shit. Now I'm completely resigned to the fact that I'll never master this." That's what Justin K. Broadrick said in an interview around the release of New Horizon, the latest album from his techno project JK Flesh. Most people would consider the industrial metal pioneer a master of many things. On New Horizon, his enduring punk spirit and expert sound design make his techno feel explosive. If it's not mastery, it's close. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Tim Hecker Konoyo Kranky 
> Tim Hecker may be known for megaphonic walls of sound, but Konoyo is a subdued affair. On his tenth solo album, the prominent experimental artist embraces negative space, integrating the ancient tones of traditional Japanese court music (gagaku) into his own desolate palette. On "Across To Anoyo," chopped gagaku samples cede seamlessly into Hecker's trademark, full-spectrum squall. The opener, "This Life," needs little more than a solitary glissando to raise the hair on your neck. While Hecker's other records construct towers of feedback and texture, Konoyo wanders the ashes of a flattened city. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Various Kulør 001 Kulør 
> Sceptics may wonder why Copenhagen's fast-techno scene has enjoyed such a golden moment in 2018. 140-BPM techno? Trance? What's new? But the music brewed in the shared flats and warehouse raves of the Danish capital is fresh and full of life, much like the young, trendy crowds who devour it every weekend in clubs across Europe and beyond. This year, Courtesy, the scene's star DJ, pulled the strings on its biggest release yet, a rich and heady compilation that proved why this sound is all the rage. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

### Deena Abdelwahed Khonnar InFine Music 
> Deena Abdelwahed once quipped, however seriously, that her goal as an artist is nothing less than finding a future for Arab culture. On Khonnar, you get a glimpse of what she has in mind. The Tunisian artist's first LP channels the conflicts and intricacies of her identity, its winding melodies and syncopated rhythms putting an Arab twist on her patchwork of club influences—techno, footwork, kuduro, UK bass—its lyrics critiquing both the Arab world and Western misconceptions of it. It is a fearless, haunting and strikingly modern album that reminds us how expressive electronic music can be. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify

### HVL Ostati Organic Analogue Records 
> Gigi Jikia, the Georgian artist known as HVL, makes records that are sleek, dreamlike and utterly sincere—finely sculpted cuts of techno that feel like intimate poems. This style reached new heights on Ostati, his first album, which came out in July. With cooing pads, drifting rhythms and a general aura of reverie, Ostati calls to mind the dance floor at Bassiani, where Jikia is a resident DJ, sometime past dawn, when the crowd thins and a bittersweet mood sets in. It is a lovely and at times transcendent album that highlights Jikia as one of the best artists in Tbilisi. Listen / Soundcloud

### Skee Mask Compro Ilian Tape 
> On his first album as Skee Mask, Shred, Bryan Müller mastered rhythm. On Compro, he mastered melody. More colourful than any previous Skee Mask release, his second album for Ilian Tape is a colorful exploration of IDM, jungle and ambient, cloaked in Müller's trademark haze. The tracks range from classic ("Kozmic Flush") to modern ("Rev8617"), but all are distinctly Skee Mask. With Compro, the young artist found the golden ratio between feeling and rhythm. Listen / Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud

## [2017's Best Albums](https://ra.co/features/3134)
Date: 2017-12-22T09:28:53.000Z

### Jlin Black Origami Planet Mu 
> "You made something 'cause it sounds good?" Jlin said in an interview this year. "For real? You're not doing enough." Her second album lives up to that ethos: Jlin completely rewrites footwork's DNA into something complex and sinister. Through singular rhythms and stark soundscapes, the American artist shows the kind raw power you can harness with drums, samples and an incredible imagination. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Equiknoxx Colón Man DDS 
> Here's an example of how to make radically weird music that still rocks a party. Since their first album last year, the Jamaican duo have sharpened their sound down to a dangerous point, arriving at a style that is menacing, psychedelic and even silly at times. Listen: Apple Music / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Lee Gamble Mnestic Pressure Hyperdub 
> Among many other subjects, Lee Gamble was wrestling with artistic development, premodern musical notation, politics and soundsystem culture when he wrote Mnestic Pressure. This makes sense. The record achieves an incredible collision, where complex themes and ideas meet the raw immediacy of the dance floor. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Kelela Take Me Apart Warp Records 
> With Take Me Apart, Kelela did what few artists can in following up a standout debut: she transformed while also getting to the heart of what makes her unique. Though she recruited a number of star producers for the album, what emerged from those sessions was an R&B masterwork that's saturated with her personality. It mixes sex, sadness, vulnerability and empowerment in a way that captures the beautiful, messy essence of real life. Listen: Apple Music / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Four Tet New Energy Text Records 
> Four Tet showed us his range in 2017. There was "Question," a simple yet insanely catchy club cut, followed by New Energy, a gorgeous, elaborate record that swings from Rounds-era sounds to lush house and quasi-trance. If his recent run of dance floor singles were lost on any of his original fans, then this album will have won them straight back. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / Spotify

### DJ Sports Modern Species Firecracker Recordings 
> Was there a more assured debut album in 2017 than Modern Species? With its humid atmospheres, light-footed percussion and wafting melodies, is the perfect soundtrack for an introspective summer's journey. In a year of great records from Aarhus's blossoming Regelbau crew, this is the standout. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Sublee Ideepsum Metereze 
> Ideepsum captures an artist looking to the past for inspiration. Made up of six club tracks for the body and mind, this double-pack is a breakout release from a little-known Romanian producer with a cosmic touch. Tech house might be a dirty term in 2017, but Sublee reaffirms its potential for enchanting dance floor moments. Listen: SoundCloud

### Young Marco Selectors 002 Dekmantel 
> Young Marco worked old-school rap, digi-dub and all manner of global oddities into his sets this year, and his Selectors compilation for Dekmantel feels like a trip around the world at 80 BPM. On this journey, we take in Wolf Müller's tropical drums, Dutch cosmic music from The Force Dimension, and new age house from Larry Heard. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### JASSS Weightless iDEAL Recordings 
> Weightless? This was one of the heaviest experimental electronic records we heard this year. The Spanish artist confirmed her status as one of the scene's most interesting newcomers, releasing this dense, industrial-infused full-length on the one hand, and tearing up Berghain's new Säule venue with her DJs sets on the other hand. Listen: SoundCloud

### Fever Ray Plunge Rabid Records 
> On Fever Ray's 2009 debut, Karin Dreijer, appearing on her own for the first time, kept her cards close to her chest, with a sound still wedded to The Knife's Silent Shout. Arriving eight years later, Plunge is an altogether different proposition, a tour-de-force that explores sexuality and politics with lyrics so blunt they can feel like rallying cries ("Free abortions! And clean water!"). Paired with characteristically alien sounds, produced together with Peder Mannerfelt, the album confirms Dreijer as one of the visionary musicians of our time. Listen: Apple Music / SoundCloud / Spotify

### John Maus Screen Memories Ribbon Music 
> Screen Memories is the result of five years spent alone in a house in rural Minnesota, where John Maus not only wrote and recorded these odd bits of synth pop, but also built the synthesizers he played them on. This gives you an idea of the eccentric mind behind Screen Memories, a record that, like all of Maus's work, is made from baroque synth melodies, post-punk rhythms and inscrutable lyrics, this time touching on subjects like the apocalypse, pets dying and football. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Visible Cloaks Reassemblage Rvng Intl. 
> Reassemblage synthesises some of 2017's most recognizable crate-digger trends—Japanese ambient, fourth world music, new age—into startlingly modern music. Using complex processing and production techniques, the American duo pay a respectful homage to their influences. It's music that hints at various cultural traditions without directly touching on them, like folk music from an alternate reality. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Laurel Halo Dust Hyperdub 
> Laurel Halo calls her third solo album, Dust, the happiest album she's made. Of course, it's not that simple—the LP's sunny dub motifs, cryptic lyrics and scattershot percussion make for a journey that's both beguiling and distant. This intricate dreamworld—constructed with help from collaborators like Klein, Lafawndah and Eli Keszler—is alien, yet intimate, with moments of warmth that draw us in again and again. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / Spotify

### LCD Soundsystem American Dream DFA Records 
> Well, they pulled it off. One of this year's big talking points was how LCD Soundsystem wrote a comeback record that exceeded expectations. American Dream doesn't soar to the anthemic highs of its predecessors, but as a front-to-back listening experience it's arguably the best record they've ever written. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Tzusing 東方不敗 L.I.E.S. 
> Tzusing's debut album is inspired by a literary character who castrates himself in order to become a more nimble martial artist. The Malaysian-Chinese producer's approach to techno is similarly concerned with agile attacks. With broken beats and exotic instrumentation borrowed from industrial and EBM, 東方不敗 is techno cut with the supple strokes of a master swordsman. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Arca Arca XL Recordings 
> On the afternoon of Wednesday 22nd February, lots of people simultaneously gasped, "Oh, shit." That was the day Arca announced his third album with "Piel," the first taste of his new vocal-led music. Exactly ten months later, it feels like the record, along with its accompanying live show and videos, is the boldest artistic statement made in electronic music this year. Listen: Apple Music / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Pessimist Pessimist Blackest Ever Black 
> On his debut album, Bristol producer Kristian Jabs pulls a striking range of ideas from a limited palette. He blends drum & bass, techno and trip-hop with a touch that's so technical it's a little scary, while immersing the listener in a bleak miasma that sticks to you. It's fitting that it came out on Blackest Ever Black: the album is draped in only the darkest hues. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Bicep Bicep Ninja Tune 
> Genres like trance and progressive house are popular for a reason: they're often produced with maximum pleasure in mind. Bicep know this. On their long-awaited debut album, they siphon the best elements of those genres into something that fits with contemporary house and techno, making for some of the best dance floor moments of the year. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Jana Rush Pariah Objects Limited 
> Last year, Chicago native Jana Rush quietly emerged from an almost 20-year hiatus with a wild-eyed footwork EP called MPC 7635. It reintroduced her as one of this year's artists to watch, and she made good on that promise with Pariah, a rhythmic rollercoaster that proves her remarkable versatility, taking in soul samples, erratic acid lines and next-level rhythmic manoeuvres. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Call Super fabric 92 Fabric Records 
> Dresvn into Objekt, Photek into Don't DJ, Walter Brown into Yves Tumor—fabric 92 is perhaps the finest example yet of Joe Seaton's fearless and idiosyncratic DJ style. But more than that, it's a monument to DJing itself, showing how, with the right combination of taste, skill and daring, mixing records can have transcendental results.

### Various Visceral Minds 2 Fractal Fantasy 
> The Visceral Minds 2 compilation is exemplary in two ways. Firstly, it makes a coherent body of work out of 20 different collaborations between the label's founders, Zora Jones and Sinjin Hawke, and others artists. Secondly, and crucially, its tracks are impressively experimental without losing a connection to the dance floor. Listen: Apple Music / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Porter Ricks Anguilla Electrica Tresor 
> The full-length return of a techno and sound design dream team, Anguilla Electrica is a perfect blend of form and function. There are hints of dub techno in its six tracks, which modulate and morph while staying tethered to a steady 4/4 pulse. Abstract yet accessible, this is 2017's most evocative techno album. Listen: Apple Music / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Octo Octa Where Are We Going? HNYTRX 
> Where Are We Going? is that rare thing: a club-ready album that grips you all the way through. Its secret is its stylistic range, subtly guiding the listener through sublime deep house, uplifting garage and brooding techno in a way that feels intuitive. As anyone who saw Octo Octa's brilliant live show can attest, hearing these tracks on a big system was a treat. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Special Request Fabriclive 91 Fabric Records 
> The average mix CD can get across a DJ's style and taste, but they're less common as a medium that shows artistic growth. Special Request's Fabriclive 91 is a spectacular exception. By absorbing electro and ambient into the hardcore continuum that, over the years, Paul Woolford's alias has refreshed with such style, the mix moves with a devil-may-care freedom and energy, summoning the spirit of one of dance music's most celebrated eras.

### Various Outro Tempo: Electronic And Contemporary Music From Brazil 1978-1992 Music From Memory 
> A golden rule of crate digging is to root around sections that others are ignoring. Madrid-born, London-based selector John Gómez went one further, following a hunch and unearthing a little-known scene of visionary experimental electronic music from Brazil. Outro Tempo introduces us to singular artists like Andréa Daltro, Maria Rita and Priscilla Ermel, and shows an important bridge between their techniques and fourth world theory. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Burnt Friedman The Pestle Latency 
> In a way Burnt Friedman's music is destined to be overlooked—the Berlin artist does his best to defy all existing musical traditions, essentially ensuring he has no comfortable place in today's musical landscape. Some of his records are so good, though, that they simply demand to be heard. Enter The Pestle, a striking and hypnotic collection that presents six of Friedman's compositions in reverse chronological order, offering a tantalizing starting point for one of electronic music's most creatively ambitious artists. Listen: Bandcamp / SoundCloud

### Varg Nordic Flora Pt. 3: Gore-Tex City Northern Electronics 
> If you couldn't already tell from his takeover of our Instagram account this year, Varg's relationship with techno is a little different from most artist's. Also see this singular album, on which, among other twists, AnnaMelina drops autotuned R&B vocals over a techno-meets-trap beat and, on a heady techno track, Yung Lean sings about killing his landlord. But don't mistake these creative decisions for gimmicks: Varg's best asset is how natural he makes breaking the rules sound. Listen: Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Steffi World Of The Waking State Ostgut Ton 
> Unlike her past work, Steffi's third album doesn't feature any vocals, but it still feels like her most personal release yet. Delicate and deeply evocative, it explores a nocturnal blend of IDM, electro and techno, the culmination of years spent collecting records and tinkering with synths. Recalling the alien sound of Ostgut Ton's early years, it's a refined LP from a veteran artist with more facets than most. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Juju & Jordash Sis-boom-bah! Dekmantel 
> On Sis-boom-bah!, Jordan Czamanski and Gal Aner break open electronic music's rigid grid by bringing a jam-band method to the table. By framing delicate keys and guitar licks within the language of psychedelic techno, they drift elegantly between driving dance tracks, ethereal electronica and transcendent ambient moments. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Actress AZD Ninja Tune 
> Darren Cunningham seemed inspired in 2017. In between travelling around India and collaborating with the world-renowned London Contemporary Orchestra, he put out AZD, an album full of the kind of woozy club music that made us fall in love with him to begin with. It contained, among other strange jams, "X22RME," one of the year's underrated club tracks. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Karen Gwyer Rembo Don't Be Afraid 
> Rembo is everything you'd want of a house and techno album. Its eight tracks are loaded with personality, conveyed through wild synth melodies, uptempo drums and amusing track titles. You'd dance all night to this music—the opportunities for which are increasing—yet its mist-in-the-woods atmosphere gives it a subtly mysterious pull. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / Spotify

### DB1 Zwischenwelt Hidden Hawaii 
> In comparing Zwischenwelt to a "mysterious obelisk," Mark Smith aptly summarised the album's enigmatic sound. It draws equally from dub techno and drum & bass, but resembles neither style. That's partly down to its use of Euclidean rhythms, each one taking turns to draw the ear. Not that much of this would cross your mind on a dance floor—you'd probably just ask, awestruck, "What the hell is this?" Listen: Apple Music / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Thundercat Drunk Brainfeeder 
> Thundercat is a virtuoso bassist who uses his powers for good—Drunk weaves tangled basslines through a psychedelic smear of funk, R&B and hip-hop, as catchy as it is complicated. It's dazed like a Saturday morning spent getting high and watching adult cartoons, with a sense of humour and the odd social commentary to match. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Micronism Inside A Quiet Mind Loop Recordings (NZ) 
> Inside A Quiet Mind collects music made in the midst of an extraordinary transformation: from techno artist to Hare Krishna. The Kiwi artist Denver McCarthy recorded these tracks in the second half of the '90s—the final stretch of his life as an artist and, by his telling, a person with an ego. It's hard not to hear this in the music itself: exquisitely reflective and atmospheric, these tracks seem to emanate from an elevated inner state. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### DJ Python Dulce Compañia Incienso 
> Out of all of Brian Piñeyro's aliases, it's the "deep reggaeton" of DJ Python that stands out the most, and Dulce Compañia is the best example of it The project's formula—slow dancehall beats that swing with the heft of dub techno—is so satisfying that you wonder how no one else thought of it before. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Ron Trent Presents Prescription - Word, Sound & Power Rush Hour Music 
> There's a "can't miss" appeal to Rush Hour's Prescription retrospective. For a few magical years in the '90s, house legends Ron Trent and Chez Damier focused on the spiritual, deep and healing aspects of dance music, crafting some of the genre's all-time classics. This six LP box set contains a staggering amount of heat—you could mix an hour or two of perfect tracks using only Word, Sound & Power. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Colleen A Flame My Love, A Frequency Thrill Jockey 
> "Descending milky night"; "Rain, rain, rain"; "be like the bat that nearly flew into my room": Cécile Schott's music has a sense of poetry well beyond what we'd normally expect from electronic music, and not just in the lyrics. Her quivering synths, delicate and vivid, are at least as expressive as her breathy, self-trained singing voice. A Flame My Love, A Frequency is her first LP free of acoustic instruments, and it may well be her best. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / Spotify

### SW. Untitled Sued Records 
> Until last year, SW. had been SUED's more silent member, with a subtler sound and slimmer release count than the label's cofounder, SVN. That all changed with Untitled, AKA The Album, a massive leap forward for both artist and label that came out on vinyl last November and then digitally this year on Apollo. A dreamlike swirl of fluttering rhythms and moonlit atmospheres, blending elements of house, ambient and drum & bass, it's rich enough that we're still picking it apart a full year later. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

### Errorsmith Superlative Fatigue PAN 
> 2017's most fun and creatively unhinged dance record arrived after six torturous years of work. "Turning the potential into a finished track is very, very hard for me," Erik Wiegand told Lisa Blanning. We're glad he persevered. The neon blend of techno and dancehall on Superlative Fatigue was unlike anything else out there this year. Listen: Apple Music / Bandcamp / SoundCloud / Spotify

## [2017's Best Tracks](https://ra.co/features/3133)
Date: 2017-12-20T10:27:36.000Z

### Objekt Theme From Q Objekt 
> Like all Objekt tracks, "Theme From Q" is probably the result of intense, painstaking work, though TJ Hertz never sounded like he was having so much fun in the studio. From the irresistible organ lead, to the backstory about the imaginary Berlin club, to the classic breakbeats and the Seinfeld-style slap bass, everything about it smacks of good-times raving.

### Yaeji Drink I'm Sippin On Godmode 
> It's hard to think of an artist who had a bigger 2017 than Yaeji. With only two EPs under her belt, the Brooklyn-based singer and producer has built a fan base of equal parts music nerds and casual listeners, and this track captures her crossover appeal. With its tough but tender trap beat, its sensual melodies and a chorus that will stick to your brain for days, "Drink I'm Sippin On" could rock a raucous house party or a heady club night.

### Binh Chalzedon Time Passages 
> Some minimal house tracks leave a crater-sized impact in spite of their subtlety. "Chalzedon," with its instant earworm bassline, is one of them. It comes from an artist who is learning how to channel his dance floor mastery as a DJ into killer productions.

### Shinichi Atobe Regret DDS 
> Shinichi Atobe couldn't have picked a more fitting title for this track, the opener from his most recent album. The word "Regret" captures the sense of yearning and loss that makes it so beautiful and, in its simplicity, reflects the arrangement of the track. Its chord progression is so perfect that it can loop uninterrupted for ten minutes with only a kick drum, hi-hats and a few passing melodies to accompany it.

### Superficie Dengue Drums Salviatek 
> These are some of the most interesting drums you'll hear in modern club music. Based loosely on the percussive rhythms of baile funk, this track from Brazilian producer Superficie is all about the clash between organic and synthetic textures. It balances genuinely futuristic sound design with grooves that are tough to resist—a rare combination that made this one of the most memorable tracks to emerge from South America's club scene this year.

### Sakro No Time To Explain raum...musik 
> Facebook went into meltdown when this video of Ricardo Villalobos spinning at Dekmantel Festival hit the internet. The track was "No Time To Explain" by Sakro, a Mexican producer better known for deeper shades of house. With a jacking beat, massive bassline and ever-rising synth, this one destroyed dance floors in 2017.

### Machine Woman Camile From OHM Makes Me Feel Loved Technicolour 
> We don't know who Camille from OHM is, or what she did to inspire this breakthrough track from the Berlin-based artist known as Machine Woman. But when those chords float in, woozy and euphoric over the crunchy drums, you might feel loved, too.

### S.A.M. Pour Aisha Delaphine 
> Samuel André Madsen is currently one of the best artists making 4/4 club tracks, and that's mostly thanks to a rare dual quality: his music is as sleek and functional as it is emotive. This has never been more true than on "Pour Aisha," a celestial trip of a tech house roller with distant echoes of Orbital. Even at 11 minutes, it always ends too soon.

### RAMZi Fuma Mood Hut 
> If you've never been to the weird world of RAMZi, then "Fuma" is a good place to start. Deflated chords, pitch-shifted vocals and snippets of conversation float over a beat that sits halfway between house and calypso but sounds completely unlike either. "Fuma" is among the most transportive tracks we heard all year.

### Pangaea Loleatta Holloway - Stand Up (Pangaea's Mix) Hadal 
> We feel a sense of strange pride that we're involved in a music scene where one of the year's biggest tracks was little more than a filtered percussion loop and a big kick drum. OK, that's massively oversimplifying things—Pangaea's manipulation of Loleatta Holloway's voice and the track's undulating arrangement were both exemplary. But this one did remind us about the simple, raw beauty that lies behind some of our favourite club tracks each year.

### Skee Mask Routine Ilian Tape 
> No track has indulged Skee Mask's love of old school beats like "Routine," a dreamy breakbeat banger from his second EP of 2017. With gentle synths and pitter-patter drums, it's a razor-sharp producer at his most introspective. If a breakbeat was ever going to make you weep, this is it.

### Coucou Chloe Stamina NUXXE 
> She's only a couple releases into her career, but the French artist Coucou Chloe represents plenty of what's good about new club music in 2017. On the EP Erika Jane she drew from the adventurous spirit of experimental club and the swagger of hip-hop, producing music that was both weird and weirdly accessible. "Stamina" was the highlight, and it was dripping with attitude.

### Samuel Kerridge Possession/Control Downwards 
> Samuel Kerridge rode into the scene a few years ago on an undulating wave of noise—sometimes ambient, sometimes grinding, always confrontational. Lately he's gone for a more kinetic sound, which hit its stride with "Possession/Control." Clocking in at around 150 BPM and calling to mind a swarm of rubber balls bouncing around a metal chamber, it's a stunning track that could signal an exciting new phase for Kerridge.

### DJ Central & Erika Casier Drive (DJ Sports Club Mix) Regelbau 
> Earworm melody, gooey vocals, slamming two-step beat—"Drive" had all the ingredients of a slinky UK garage cut, except it wasn't brewed in some East London bedroom, but in Aarhus, the Danish city responsible for some of the best dance music around right now. 2017 might have been chock-a-block with '90s throwbacks, but few were this classy.

### Batu Marius Hessle Audio 
> Batu has a sculptor's sense for detail, but rarely has he made anything as beautiful—or as imposing—as "Marius." It's dense, with asymmetrical layers of tone and rhythm, and, as always, the moving parts are as intricate as a clock's. Once they give way to the gorgeous chime melody in the breakdown, it feels as though time has stopped.

### Denis Sulta Dubelle Oh XX (JVIP) Sulta Selects 
> "Dubelle Oh XX (JVIP)," a synthy club weapon, was made in direct response to an argument that took place on a rainy night in Glasgow—the cataclysmic drop that turns the track on its head is the "fuck you." But the maddest thing? Jackmaster—who this version was made for—had to beg Sulta to leave that part in.

### Oluko Imo Praise-Jah Invisible City Editions 
> "Praise-Jah," first released in 1978, is an uncommon fusion of gospel, soca and disco. It's a heartfelt tribute to the titular deity, but it doesn't rely only on religious fervour—tweeting electronics, fun vocal interplays, rich funk keys, salt-sprinkled synths and the sing-a-long chorus will raise your spirits, too.

### Galaxian‎ Dosing The Population lower parts 
> This year, as RA staff argued in this year's retrospective essays, electro moved from the peripheries of electronic music to the centre. Scottish artist Galaxian is one of the artists who made this feel so urgent and exciting. "Dosing The Population," with its tense ambience and blindingly fast tempo, channels the paranoid ethos of classic electro without leaning on retro tropes.

### Tzusing 日出東方 唯我不敗 L.I.E.S. 
> "日出東方 唯我不敗" opens one of the year's best techno albums in head-turning style—though it's hardly even techno. The robust string instrumentation and drum programming have more in common with Nine Inch Nails or Meat Beat Manifesto, pop-industrial influences that make Tzusing's creations feel unusually flexible.

### Sawlin Motion Keeper Delsin 
> "Motion Keeper" is deep techno smeared with a delicious sludge. Every surface seems slicked with oil, and in the track's viscous low- and mid-ranges, as Holly Dicker wrote a few months ago, you'll find a "subaqeous, womb-like environment you won't want to leave."

### natural/electronic.system. Sicut Erat Tikita 
> After ten years with no releases, we'd assumed that Antonio Giova and Valerio Gomez De Ayala were content with gradually building their small but dedicated following as DJs. Then this EP dropped on the excellent Tikita label that summarised everything that's great about their sets. The title track in particular showed the depth and creeping atmospherics that have drawn people to their vision of techno.

### Klein Cry Theme Hyperdub 
> "Not everyone is gonna like this," the New York artist Embaci said to Klein in a recent Radar Radio video. She was remembering their conversation when Klein first played her "Cry Theme," the standout track from the Tommy EP. It is difficult to recall a piece of music recently whose emotions are so extreme yet so ambiguous, which is probably the best possible sign that Klein's music, and "Cry Theme" in particular, is something genuinely innovative.

### Photek ‎T'Raenon (Version) ART Records 
> This 1996 track, remastered and reissued this year by Kirk Degiorgio, was the precise moment Photek went from master of one genre to a broadly visionary producer. Effortlessly combining techno and drum & bass, it predicted Photek's future turn towards house and techno. It might just be the crown jewel in his catalogue.

### MSPE Son Goku Referenz 
> The A1 from one of 2017's most sought-after white labels, "Son Goku" was a dreamy minimal cut from two exciting Frankfurt-area artists. It's all about the descending bassline, which feels like staring across an infinity pool on a moonlit night. Perfect for those afterhours sessions where yesterday's party is a distant memory, this is spellbinding music.

### Detboi Claws Metalheadz 
> The Irish producer's gleefully punishing double EP for Metalheadz reimagines old-school drum & bass as 130 BPM broken techno, although "Claws" is slightly more traditional. More importantly, it's a lesson in the art of the second drop. When those kicks return after the first time, if you're not air drumming then you're doing it wrong.

### Leif July V TIO-Series 
> Lurching drums mark a rhythm that feels oddly hip-hop, despite clocking in at 128 BPM. Chimes swirl in kaleidoscopic patterns, as dazzling as they are disorienting. Leif Knowles has long been a master of surreal grooves and textures, but on "July V" he outdid himself.

### KH Question Text Records 
> Like much of the music Kieran Hebden released this year, "Question" arrived unexpectedly, this time on a white label slipped onto the shelves of London record stores Phonica Records and Sounds Of The Universe. The edit—a soul side revved up to James Brown-level frenzy—is pure dance floor heat, good for both Dekmantel's main stage and your local pub. This quick and dirty DJ tool showed one of dance music's leading lights just having fun.

### Minor Science Volumes Whities 
> With each new record, Minor Science (an alias of RA staff writer Angus Finlayson) pushes the envelope a little more, testing how far you can break from convention while maintaining a club-friendly flow. "Volumes," the A-side from his latest 12-inch for Whities, seems to intentionally dance on either side of that line. If you have any doubt about the power of experimentation in dance music, just watch the way a club reacts to that breakdown.

### Bullion Blue Pedro The Trilogy Tapes 
> Bullion, real name Nathan Jenkins, has spent the last few years immersed in the '80s, making leftfield dance cuts that integrate guitars, vocal samples and vintage synths lifted from the Thatcher era. This year for The Trilogy Tapes, he looked seaward and reached an ebullient peak. It's safe to say "Blue Pedro" is the catchiest space disco sea shanty you'll ever hear.

### Powder Heart Cocktail D'Amore 
> Cosmic disco may be out of the spotlight, but that didn't stop Powder from releasing one of the style's modern gems. Bright, spacey and deceptively complex, "Heart" utilised harmony like few other tracks this year. When that soaring synth hits, it's time to strap on your helmet: you're going into space.

### Equiknoxx Congo Get Slap (Mark Ernestus Remix) DDS 
> This was one of the year's more unexpected exchanges—the German dub techno godfather Mark Ernestus remixing the Jamaican production duo Equiknoxx. Ernestus smooths out the original's bright textures and angular contours while preserving its fun, unpredictable rhythms (and adding a significant amount of sub-bass). It's a tricky one to dance to, but if you're DJing to an adventurous crowd, give this a play and see what happens.

### Kara-Lis Coverdale Grafts Boomkat Editions 
> On this 22-minute composition, the Canadian artist Kara-Lis Coverdale refines her exploratory methods for a rousing piece that combines Reichian minimalism with her own penchant for treated electronics. By turns beautiful, startling and relaxing, Grafts sews musical traditions into its own exquisite tapestry.

### Parris Your Kiss Is Sour Hemlock Recordings 
> There's a seductive sense of space in the music of Parris, a Bristol-based artist with a potently sparing take on UK club sounds. Perhaps none of his records have been as reduced as this track for Hemlock, the label he says got him into dance music. Made up of little more than cooing pads, gurgling synths and disembodied whispers, it was this year's most compelling support for the maxim "less is more."

### Octo Octa Adrift (Avalon Emerson's Furiously Awake Remix) Honey Soundsystem 
> How do you remix an already great track? Avalon Emerson's "Furiously Awake" version of Octo Octa's "Adrift" is a textbook answer—keep the best bits (the gloomy lead, the drone trails) and go crazy with the rest. By adding energetic hand drums and breakbeats, Emerson turns "Adrift"'s slimline deep house into a menacing roller that seems to swallow the horizon.

### Person Of Interest Boost The Whip (I-95 Mix) Future Times 
> Future Times' single-sided 12-inch series is so on point that each new record is basically buy-on-sight. They didn't disappoint with their latest addition, seven minutes of crunchy breakbeats paired with ecstatic '90s house samples that will immediately raise the room temperature.

### Forest Drive West Static Livity Sound 
> After several releases of spooky and spiky drum tracks spanning various tempos, Forest Drive West stripped things back and delivered a four-to-the-floor bomb. "Static," with its scythe-sharp claps and contender for bassline of the year, is simple dance floor gold.

### Errorsmith I'm Interesting, Cheerful & Sociable PAN 
> We take it Errorsmith did not intend to describe himself with this title, but consider this: can the maker of such wild and original music not be "interesting"? Could this song's demented spin on techno and dancehall not be considered "cheerful"? And could the creation of a track so deliriously fun not be "sociable"?

### Shanti Celeste Make Time Idle Hands 
> The last time Shanti Celeste partnered with Idle Hands we got "Days Like This," a beautiful deep house cut that signalled the arrival of a new talent. Three years later, she returns to the label with "Make Time," which might be the best record she's ever made. Pumping yet melancholic, it was maybe 2017's sweetest dance floor bomb.

### Ryuichi Sakamoto Andata (Oneohtrix Point Never rework) Milan Records 
> The majority of Daniel Lopatin's recent work has reached towards a synthetic portrayal of emotion. He had his work cut out for him taking on the heartrending opener from the Japanese master's 2017 album, async. But OPN rose to the occasion, using digital koto, widescreen synth leads and desolate reverb to evoke android heartbreak.

### D. Tiffany How RU Plush feat. Regularfantasy Pacific Rhythm 
> "Hi! How are you? I'm tryna dance." D. Tiffany's dazed house track, featuring deadpan vocals from Regularfantasy, perfectly translates the numbing feeling of having forced conversations on the dance floor. It's a wry commentary that also features one of the year's most understated yet catchy grooves.

### Joe Tail Lift Hessle Audio 
> Joe pops up every couple years with a sound that makes you dance and scratch your head, in that order. For "Tail Lift," he loaded wacky sound effects into an irrepressible leftfield banger.

### Phil Evans Saniti raum...musik 
> While his peers look to '90s techno and electro for inspiration, Phil Evans channelled a different sound on his first EP for raum...musik. From the lullaby melody to the shuffling hi-hats, Thomas Melchior's influence felt strong on "Saniti," one of 2017's best minimal tracks.

### Nkisi Kill MW 
> Nkisi, a cofounder of NON, delivered a rare solo EP this year that made us wish there were more. "Kill" takes a deliberate approach to experimental club music: there are jerky basslines and percussive devices that pop like gunshots, sure, but there's also the sensuously slinky beat and a beautiful melody trilling in the background.

### Ancient Methods Born Of Ashes Persephonic Sirens 
> "Born Of Ashes" only kicks at 124 BPM, but it's among 2017's meanest techno tracks. No producer blends grit and funk like Ancient Methods, and there's no better example of his sound than this seven-minute wrecking ball. When the synth goes into overdrive halfway through, dance floors explode.

### Pile Noshow Perlon 
> "Done this before," a voice intones at the beginning of "Noshow," a collaboration by Perlon's three principal members—Chris Rehberger, Zip and Markus Nikolai. And it's true: in the past 20 years, Perlon have blown our minds again and again with oddball electronics that bring to club music a rare humour and avant-garde flair. And yet, they hadn't quite done this, an otherworldly chill-out track of cartoon melodies and slinking rhythms, one which proves that Perlon, all these years later, still have plenty left to do.

### DJ Lycox Solteiro Principe 
> We could have picked a few tracks from Sonhos & Pesadelos, DJ Lycox's full debut on Príncipe, but there was something about the sun-soaked "Solteiro" that stayed with us. The roughness of the percussion blended beautifully with the smoothness of the synths and samples, evoking a sweltering Lisbon summer evening. The range of moods and styles on this EP—and Príncipe's output this year generally—showed just how deep the well of creativity is in the city's Afro-Portuguese club music scene.

### PTU A Broken Clock Is Right Twice A Day Trip 
> "Mmmmmm! Pow! Ding!" went the highlight from this deliciously strange EP. Trip and PTU did more than most this year to show that there's still plenty of originality left in the 30-year-old techno formula. "A Broken Clock Is Right Twice A Day" broke the rules at 146 BPM, pairing a steady kick-drum thump with mind-bending one shots and a rude bassline.

### Christoph De Babalon Could We Be? V I S 
> The veteran breakcore and drum & bass producer Christoph De Babalon counts Thom Yorke and Alec Empire among his fans, so perhaps it's not surprising that the A-side of his latest record should be so mind-bendingly good. The mood is one of cosmic dread; the drums, arranged in impossibly complex patterns at a tempo north of 160 BPM, are like asteroids whipping through space. Good luck not getting lost in this one.

### Bicep Glue Ninja Tune 
> Bicep are masters of one of dance music's darkest arts: making a club track with pop appeal. "Glue," the standout from this year's RA-recommended debut album, was the Belfast duo's "homage to the rave era," a slice of punchy breakbeat that slowly unfurled into one of 2017's most emotional bangers. For the full experience, see Joe Wilson's moving video.

### Kyle Hall Teacher Plant Wild Oats 
> Kyle Hall is now firmly within his hippie period, extolling the virtues of psychedelics and sweet potatoes in the liner notes for his sole 2017 release, Eutrophia Sevan. "Teacher Plant" continues on this good trip, bouncing along with warm Rhodes, spaced-out synths and a loping bassline. The track's effortless musicality improved upon the broken-beat foundation of his last album, From Joy, making it the latest milestone in the Detroit producer's steady progression.

### Dana Ruh Go Hmmm!? Cave Recordings 
> Dana Ruh moved from warm-up to peak-time with Cave Jams Vol. 1, a meaty deep house EP made for busy dance floors. Best heard on "Go Hmmm!?," the synths were jazzy and the basslines were bold, hitting a groove that feels like it could go all night.

### Björk Blissing Me One Little Indian 
> Utopia tells the story of Björk learning how to open up and love again, and "Blissing Me" is its most tender moment. The lyrics convey the excitement, nerves and insecurity of courtship, as Björk wonders aloud, "Is this excess texting a blessing? / Two music nerds obsessing." Accompanied by ornate harp and music box, Björk made the act of texting sound majestic.

### Ciel Elevate (Go Off Mix) Peach Discs 
> Plenty about "Elevate (Go Off Mix)" is noteworthy—the unusual breakbeats, the soothing kalimba spirals, the weepy piano chords, the angelic pads. Its emotional core, though, is what really shines through.

### Lanark Artefax Touch Absence Whities 
> On "Touch Absence," angelic chorale synths flank a rude electro beat. This hushed, sacred tone—and the fact that AFX and Björk have been playing it—make the track feel like a coronation, positioning Calum MacRae as the rightful heir to the Artificial Intelligence throne.
