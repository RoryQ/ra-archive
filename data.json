Where the nascent internet's frontier spirit once pointed to a bright future, today that promise feels sinister, curdled","Emotional Machine Funk2025 has been defined by the collapse of techno optimism. Where the nascent internet's frontier spirit once pointed to a bright future, today that promise feels sinister, curdled by the \"corporate gloom\" and data extraction documented in Liz Pelly's excellent book, Mood Machine. The year's most compelling machine funk reflects this irradiated state of distress on a personal and collective level, as well as caution about what our technological destiny truly holds.The electro, techno and slanted IDM we listened to in 2025 went beyond techno pessimism to focus on other knotty concepts, such as grief and loss, provoking visceral gut punches to attain those physical highs. It's music that makes you feel and move, which, if you go back to Detroit techno's history, has always been there. No one told this story better than the Motor City's early pioneers, whose fragile and furious proto-techno output was never blindly optimistic. RA's staff picks of the year pull from this DNA: DJ Bone's The End Of Never, with its muscular electro, stands as the embodiment of Detroit, rooted in a '90s urban reality that focused on interrogating systems of power and decay.These ghosts of past motifs echo through these releases, which are neither hopeful nor nostalgic throwbacks. This is machine music deeply rooted in the turmoil of the present, asserting that the sound of the zeitgeist refuses to be background noise. It's a defiant new link in a chain of creation that speaks to adversity, and it demands that we listen. What does that say about 2025, that artists are trying to produce music that says something through bleeps and bloops again?– Chloe LulaRecord of the YearBlawanSickElixirAfter more than a decade at the forefront of club music, Blawan could easily have settled into legacy act territory, churning out formulaic imitations of past successes from the comfort of the techno assembly line. Instead, on SickElixir, he doubles down on innovation.The album finds the UK artist at his most vulnerable. Themes of grief, trauma and addiction (he recently spoke to Crack about having to leave Berlin after drugs \"basically shattered\" his life there) are folded into serrated rhythms and monstrous, almost bodily vocal work—even fleeting moments of warmth arrive refracted through a darker lens. The ferocity of his early work remains, yet the melodic smears, fragmented vocal gasps and unexpectedly tender swells reflect an artist intent on expanding his emotional bandwidth. SickElixir sees Blawan turn years of experience into something raw and profound.– Michael LawsonRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordsMarie DavidsonCity Of ClownsIn a world shackled by surveillance capitalism, Marie Davidson posits what might be the only true subversion left: satirising this power structure with sexual hedonism run rampant. City Of Clowns brings this madcap concept to life. Thunderous, funky basslines and mind-melting electro synths are helmed by Davidson, who plays the Alexa-like narrator gone rogue, extolling the virtues of data mining with expletives and double entendres. If the machinist future our tech overlords are envisioning is even one tenth as sexy as this, bring on the singularity.– Jake IndianaRead the full reviewListen:BandcampUnspecified EnemiesRomance in the Age of Adaptive FeedbackPart of the enduring magic of '90s Detroit-school techno is how the producers made pieces of hardware sing. Louis Digital isn't from Detroit and it isn't the mid-90s, but you can't tell by listening to Romance in the Age of Adaptive Feedback. Equal parts nostalgic and futuristic, brimming with feeling and assembly-line grooves, the record is a pitch-perfect homage to classic Motor City techno and electro by a true lover of the form.– Henry IvryRead the full reviewListen:BandcampTracksDJ Bone\"Deep Inside\"On \"Deep Inside,\" DJ Bone pairs his famously surgical drumwork with a simple vocal mantra, a reminder that there's a human pulse driving the circuitry. As the oscillating synths kick in, elastic and almost overcooked, the track feels like a machine learning its purpose, pushed by a human hand that refuses to let the gears lock into place.

His Ilian Tape mix opens with tight 303 sequences: clean resonance peaks, controlled envelopes and a filter sweep that traces a line from forebears like Robert Hood and Jeff Mills. Rather than treat acid as nostalgia, the mix unfolds with curiosity, moving through Drexciya-esque passages and punchy electro workouts.

From late 2024 through 2025, bass weight has been pushed into new places. From Bristol outlet Dimeshift, which continues to lead fresh, first wave-inspired dubstep, to Beatrice M., who released a strong run of their own tunes, as well as issuing music from the likes of Tighe, Old Man Crane and Dangermami via their label, Bait.Across the board, artists increasingly unified the roots of sound system music with their own astute, modern twists, propelled by a more femme-led, internationally reaching school of artists and labels. Introspekt's Moving the Center unlocked a newfound sensuality in dubstep and dark garage; tracks like Mia Koden's \"Skank Steady\" bottled anticipation for summer with floating keys and a warm bassline; Lauren Duffus's excellent Can's Gone Warm EP served weighty alt-pop, folding in trip-hop and post-dubstep shimmer reminiscent of Kelela's Cut 4 Me. And then Tracey & Riko Dan's \"Sex Life\" abandoned elegance entirely, taking a thrumming low-end and plonking a pithy hook on top: \"All I wanna do is fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.\"Alongside Beatrice M., names like EMA were busy earning much-deserved flowers with standout festival sets, while legends assembled in the form of Mala and dub techno veteran Paul St. Hilaire, who collaborated on \"Like It's Always Been,\" the opening track on St. Hilaire's album. In a year that Timedance and SPE:C turned ten (and Tectonic hit 20), techno-infused bass weight stocks are arguably at an all-time high, and sound system music at large is, in all senses of the word, booming.– Nathan EvansRecord of the YearPaul St. Hilairew/ the ProducersFor Kynant Records' Richard Akingbehin and the voice of dub techno, Paul St. Hilaire, the decision to summon the ghost of Rhythm & Sound's seminal 2003 album, w/ the Artists, was classy yet bold. Would w/ the Producers build on its source material? Or risk living in its shadow? The album's faultless cast of collaborators, including Batu, Shinichi Atobe and Azu Tiwaline, made failure impossible. As a sonic aesthetic, dubwise is flourishing right now, and this LP bottles its power and beauty in myriad tones and tempos, from Mala's orchestral skank on \"Like It's Always Been\" to the slo-mo psych thump of Aurora Halal & DJ G's \"Mary Jane Greenfield.\" The pièce de résistance is, of course, St. Hilaire himself. He graces every beat with poise and purpose, never overdoing it. As the years roll by, once-mythic musicians can lose touch with their former brilliance. Not this Dominican dub poet.– Carlos HawthornRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordsIntrospektMoving The CenterIntrospekt has what you want and what you need. Sound familiar? You might recognise those words from KMA Productions' '96 garage track \"Cape Fear,\" which Introspekt samples on \"Subliminate,\" the final track on her debut album. From the New York-based artist, what we want is something new, fresh and stimulating in a way we've not experienced before. And what we need is dubstep. Introspekt delivers both, making bass-heavy 140 riddims sound smoother and sexier than ever.– Sam DaviesRead the full reviewListen:Bandcampex_libris001 & 002Every time Dave Huismans returns, it's cause for celebration. Just one catch: the lexicon of writers and fans alike falls short in capturing his aversion to fixed form. What exactly is ex_libris? Iridescent, deep electronics, backed by a swirl of percussion and an exceptional attention to textural detail? Rolls right off the tongue. At any rate, this headphone-friendly double drop sums the qualities of his best-known projects—2562's swampy low-end, A Made Up Sound's nonlinear jams—in a teeming soundscape with an almost hydraulic sense of progression. \"It has a lot of character,\" he once told us about his gear, \"and that's why I like it.\" Dave, the feeling's mutual.– Gabriel SzatanListen:BandcampTracksTracey\"Sex Life\"The anonymous London-based duo knocked everyone out of the park with their self-titled debut. Press play once and you'll be convinced. \"Sex Life\" is deadly dubstep in classic form, with a searing verse from vaunted MC Riko Dan. But then, there's a twist. \"Sex Life\" also features surprising interludes of twinkling synths and bubblegum vocal loops with a bedroom pop feel—inflections that add a touch of irreverent internet humour. It's a perfect marriage of neon pop and bass weight—a uniquely 2025 take on dubstep.– Nyshka ChandranListen:BandcampLauren Duffus\"N.U.M.T.E.\"Lauren Duffus's Can's Gone Warm EP is her best work yet. On \"N.U.M.T.E,\" fragile, R&B-inflected vocals float over jittery breakbeats and shadowy synths, recalling the likes of Murlo and MssingNo without ever feeling derivative. The track inhabits the liminal space between the club and the lonely hours after closing, leaving a lingering sense of longing wrapped in mystery. It's exactly the kind of idiosyncratic, emotionally vivid production that marked Duffus as one of the year's most compelling artists.– Fahad AkinsanyaListen:BandcampMixBeatrice M.THE DUBSTEP - TECH HOUSE CONNECTIONIn this NTS Radio entry, Beatrice M. explores the connection between two once maligned genres, dubstep and tech house. Joined by Appleblim, they map the sonic bridge from Bristol to Berlin, zeroing in on the collision point where technoid bass hybrids meet skippy 120-BPM rollers—the juncture where Villalobos can bring low-end into his sets or Shackleton can put steppers onto Perlon.

Would w/ the Producers build on its source material? Or risk living in its shadow? The album's faultless cast of collaborators, including Batu, Shinichi Atobe and Azu Tiwaline, made failure impossible. As a sonic aesthetic, dubwise is flourishing right now, and this LP bottles its power and beauty in myriad tones and tempos, from Mala's orchestral skank on \"Like It's Always Been\" to the slo-mo psych thump of Aurora Halal & DJ G's \"Mary Jane Greenfield.\" The pièce de résistance is, of course, St. Hilaire himself.

But in 2025, a sort of reverse osmosis emerged: cutting-edge producers found new avenues for experimentation in pop's effervescent packaging. From Shanti Celeste's glossy love songs on Romance to Oli XL's K-pop meets IDM on Lick The Lens, there's a clear uptick in the use of radio-ready melodies. In a moment when big-room dance music is more mainstream (and more mind-numbing) than ever, underground artists returned to pop as a point of subversion; a new way to enliven drum & bass, trance and trip-hop without sullying the source material.The relationship between pop and dance music dates back to the '80s, when artists like Boy George and The Human League first conceived of pop as a self-aware art form, not a chart metric. Their vision was fuelled by the same anti-establishment spirit that influenced club innovators like Larry Heard and Underground Resistance. In 2025, pop sounds more in line with that original art punk mentality than it has in decades. There's always been pop worth dancing to, but it's been a long time since so many skilled dance music producers have contributed to the cause.– Hattie LindertRecord of the YearOklouchoke enoughThe off‑centre vaporwave pop songs on Oklou's radical debut make for perfect bedroom music. The French musician's hypnagogic dream logic and tender harmonies render life's most existential moments with microscopic precision and a lulling calm. \"endless\" opens like a beacon from a far‑off village, her dulcet, auto‑tuned vocals shutting out all notifications from the outside world. \"thank you for recording\" turns surveillance into a lullaby, while \"blade bird\" crystallises the album's themes of attachment and harm into weightless nursery rhymes. In the background hum of 2025's global crises, this kind of dissociative dream pop feels spot on, turning panic into an exquisitely arranged experience.

Whether an attempt to make sense of a world still vibrating with instability, or simply a rejection of the overpolished club tools that continue to flood the scene, some of the year's best releases have been forged from the cracks—records that find beauty in disintegration.At the centre of this shift is a renewed fascination with noise and distortion, not only as sonic aesthetic but as emotional language. Disparate artists seem to be drawn to sounds that carry strain, abrasion or a sense of dislocation. Distortion communicates pressure—be that in a personal sense or wider communities navigating upheaval. Even when artists such as Los Thuthanaka or aya pushed their palettes into raw or blown-out territory, it was less about harshness for its own sake and more about revealing what lay beneath the polish.Equally, distortion took on a more introspective bent. Producers working in slower or more reflective modes—Klein, DJ Haram, Rainy Miller—leaned into erosion as a kind of emotional texture. Their use of noise suggested memory slipping, feelings blurring, structures softening rather than breaking.While far from a new phenomenon, perhaps this turn toward noise is a response to an era defined by overstimulation. Amid algorithmic smoothness and endless playlists, distortion feels like something human again. It restores the club's physicality: a reminder that dance music has always thrived on what doesn't quite fit, on frequencies that shake your body as much as they move your feet.– Michael LawsonRecord of the YearLos ThuthanakaLos ThuthanakaUnless you experience synesthesia, listening to Los Thuthanaka might be the closest you'll get to seeing sound. Digitised Andean folk music brings to mind brown mountains and deep blue lakes, while corroded synths are redlined to evoke a radioactive lime green. The first collaborative album from siblings Joshua Crampton and Chuquimamani-Condori melds Andean folk, queer psychedelia and staticky ambient into an ultra-digital experience. Crampton's chugging electric guitar provides the bedrock, setting the atmosphere ablaze while Chuquimamani-Condori gets busy with their sampler, adding bursts of humour via cartoonish, pitched-down voices yelling \"Yo!\" or \"Grrrrr!\" over sun-dappled rhythms. These crackling loops become heaving, transcendental waves of sound, haptic feedback sent all the way down from their ancestors.– Kiana MicklesRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordsayahexed!Trauma scuffs your spirit, the way an explosion leaves your ears ringing. aya's mesmerising second album seeks to confront her past battles with substance addiction head-on and out loud.

In 2025, albums were rarely anchored to one sound, often enlisting the malleable quality of the guitar to transform electronic beats into rock ballads. As one of the oldest instruments, guitars can provoke a jolt of time-worn emotion. That tug on the heart when you hear a lonely minor key? Practically baked into human DNA. Ambling post-rock arpeggios can inspire visions of pastoral terrain, while an indie-pop glissando might give you a new lease of life. Fans clamour to see Smerz's dramatic live rendition of \"You got time and I got money,\" while at home they hit replay for the moping chords that stretch out below the duo's honeyed lyrics.Rock faded out of the mainstream in the late '00s, as EDM, rap and pop surged across the next decade. The genre struggled to reclaim its place in the zeitgeist, until a post-pandemic malaise stalked the music industry and everyone reached for their guitars. Copenhagen—which, in addition to Smerz, is home to Astrid Sonne, ML Buch and Erika de Casier—led the charge. Using the guitar as a textural tool, these artists built layers atop introspective electronic foundations. They bottled a year of political turmoil and economic decline into songs that felt double-sided, capturing a youthful angst alongside a yearning for something, anything, more.– Kiana MicklesRecord of the Yearjames KFriendOn Friend, Jamie Krasner wields her guitar with the freedom of an acrobat flying through the air. Using space to transformative effect, she defies expectations of electronic pop songwriting through her mastery of genre. Wispy tones lap gently against glowing reverbed vocals, bringing an expansive feel to the album's unique strain of ethereality.There's no doubt Krasner can shred in a more classic indie rock vein (see \"On God\"'s swathes of dream pop chords), but where she really excels is in transforming the guitar altogether through sampling and meticulously applied FX. Whether it's chugging alongside the peppy heartbeat drums on \"Play,\" sputtering over choral vocal samples on the cavernous \"Rider\" or undulating at the core of trip-hoppy \"Blinkmoth (July Mix),\" her guitar shapeshifts throughout Friend's electronic landscape as mutably as a synth could.– Sue ParkRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordsAcopiaBlush ResponseAcopia's third album is a shimmering haze of shoegaze guitars and soft, yearning vocals. Moving away from the drum programming and grittier, bass-driven sound of previous records, Blush Response revels in downtempo, sparse grooves and cool-headed trip-hop. Vocalist Kate Durman channels her lilting soubrette over distorted fuzz, reverb-laden guitar tones and the wonky harmonics of tracks like \"Chase Me\" and \"Let Down.\" The album is a dreamlike, wafting soundworld seen through bleary eyes.– Ammar KaliaRead the full reviewListen:BandcampJoanne RobertsonBlurrrIn a year full of albums that sound like they might have drifted from an abandoned campsite, Blurrr distinguishes itself with the subtle spectrum of sound it teases from everyday tools.

It's the Copenhagen duo's own \"Bittersweet Symphony,\" an orchestral love song that documents the thrill of a new relationship. Although the track's smoky bass guitar plucks a refrain in D minor sharp—the key of mourning—it still lands as a serene dispatch from the honeymoon phase, all warm embraces and waking up together. Over the smoothest drumline of the year, Catharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt wallow in a grounded romance: patient, consistent and built to endure.– Hattie LindertListen:BandcampNourished By Time\"Max Potential\"The brazen heart of \"Max Potential\" is riven: between passion and resignation, romance and staying true to oneself.

Think Maya Jane Coles' \"What They Say,\" Kassem Mosse's \"Untitled (A1)\" or J","Club HeatersAt the end of every year, we usually identify a single track that seemed to unite every club and festival stage. Think Maya Jane Coles' \"What They Say,\" Kassem Mosse's \"Untitled (A1)\" or Joy Orbison's 2024 smash \"flight fm,\" tracks that sliced clean through our imagined trenches and could make any dance floor move in unison.In 2025, it felt like that moment never quite materialised. Don't get us wrong: the absence of a unanimous dance floor heater doesn't mean there wasn't a slew of excellent club music coming out. It's more that the heat got more localised. It's long been true that what goes off in, say, New York, stands apart from what works in Ibiza, and this year, those differences made the notion of a single, standout club anthem untenable.The lack of universal hits, however, meant more breathing room. This year, the producers soundtracking peak-time moments have stayed small, specific and rooted. For the cohort revelling against AI slop, algorithmic sameness and other homogenising forces, the result was a landscape defined by artistic pluralism and local autonomy rather than one-size-fits-all trends.This shift hints at progress. The appetite for hard and fast persists, sure, but it mutated, shaped by space, crowd and context. Instead of one monolithic sound dominating the scene, you get micro-moments: whether that be the Come Round EP by DJ PGZ & Yikes, two Aboriginal producers staking their claim on the sound of Australian dance floors and bush doofs; or Kiara Scuro and Sugar Free, whose respective releases channelled a sleazy, slow-burning chug familiar to anyone who has clocked in hours at fabric or Houghton. A welcome reminder that the notion of peak time can—and should—offer something different for every floor.– Bella AquilinaRecord of the YearDJ PGZ & YikesCome RoundCome Round has the unbridled energy of a peak-time dance floor coursing through it. Gunai/Kurnai and Yorta Yorta artist DJ PGZ and Boorloo-based Wongi artist Yikes forged their bond in underground spaces—from DJ PGZ attending formative queer parties to inviting Yikes to play his first set at Sub Club in Naarm. Here, that early spark comes full circle. Across solo cuts, cross-remixes and a standout joint track, \"Ouss Ouss,\" the release maps two artists searching for, and ultimately locking into, unity in their respective sounds.It's full throttle from the get‑go: all big, wubby basslines, fierce vocal chops and swirling crescendos that summon the kind of feral inhibition only a grimy basement can unlock. DJ PGZ's pulsing hard techno interlocks with Yikes's spacious, trance-leaning grooves, all threaded by percussive broken beats. The result captures a powerful moment, as two First Nations producers propel Australian dance music into its next chapter.– Hannah DoodyListen:BandcampRecordsKiara ScuroNight Crush​​On Kassian's Rinse FM show in February, Rosie Ama described Night Crush, the debut (and final) Kiara Scuro EP, as \"an ode to being on the dance floor when you don't really know what time it is.\" That disoriented thrill runs through all three tracks: the haziness of heavy reverb and the way the deep, rolling grooves lock your body into the rhythm. Every so often, a repeating riff on opener \"Witching Hour\" invites that movement, murmuring \"body, in motion.\" File this one with your favourite Planet Euphorique releases.– Katie ThomasListen:BandcampSugar FreeDisociandoJust like her DJ sets, Sugar Free's debut EP squirms with amoebic movement. Disociando's prog house and tech house cuts swell and contract like jellyfish in water, balancing moments of hips-swaying bliss with heads-down enthralment. Pared-back drums add tension and a touch of sleaze, while gorgeous textural details—oddball synth burbles and feedback buildups—bring a zany experimentalism into the mix. This striking amalgam of psychedelia, minimal house and bounce is a peak-time treat with grit and groove, but it's also slinky enough to work the afters.– Nyshka ChandranRead the full reviewListen:BandcampTracksWOST\"Banda\"Not \"banda\" as in band, but as in crew. This Spanish translation nails the mantra of the global posse that WOST and Colombian label TraTraTrax have been rallying over the years. On \"Banda,\" the Bogotá-based producer unleashes a percussive cut that's travelled from Video Club to Rinse FM. There's FM synthesis, a drum breakdown and a sped-up dembow tresillo beat so syncopated it sounds like it might mutate into dubstep with each bar. As the gap between the Latin American and UK undergrounds keeps closing, \"Banda\" proves electronic fusion never has to dilute flavour.– Rachel Grace AlmeidaListen:BandcampJump Source\"On (feat. Martyn Bootyspoon)\"Patrick Holland and Priori have been quietly producing with other artists—like james K and Physical Therapy—from their Montreal studio. They've still had time to crank out earworms like \"On,\" a euphoric club track so infectious it disarms even the most dedicated techno purists. The confluence of Jump Source's meticulous production and Martyn Bootyspoon's signature vocal swagger is a showcase in style that feels both retro-futurist and viscerally current. In a sense, it's the sound of 2025—a reach for nostalgic sounds that sits undeniably in the present.– Chloe LulaListen:BandcampMixDJ Tobzy Imole GiwaLagos City UnloadedThe algorithm demands bitesized clips of DJs blending belters together. You can either curse this tyranny, or do like DJ Tobzy Imole Giwa does and exaggerate the formula. On Lagos City Unloaded, the cruise beat DJ blitzes through hyperspeed pop, R&B and Eurodance alongside continental genres like Afrobeat, kwaito and amapiano. During one flurry, Lil Wayne's famous \"A Milli\" a capella creeps in with the subtlety of Looney Tunes's Sylvester before being ousted by the Tweety Bird-pitched trill of Yves Larock's \"Rise Up.\" As DJ Tobzy pushes everything he touches to cartoonish extremes, he makes disparate genres find copious common ground.– Joseph FrancisListen:BandcampFurther ListeningBaaltiMelaRead the reviewListen:BandcampPloyIt's Later Than You ThinkRead the reviewListen:BandcampKhadija Al Hanafi\"Bounce It On The Flo\"Listen:BandcampJSPORT\"No Turning Back\"Listen:BandcampKontronatura b2b Nick LeónCarnaval Novo AffairListen:SoundCloudListen to the Club Heaters playlistSpotify","/features/4350",2025,-1,0,0],["","Sugar FreeDisociandoJust like her DJ sets, Sugar Free's debut EP squirms with amoebic movement.

And no song in 2024 made as great an escape as Nick León and Erika de Casier's \"Bikini.\"\"It leaks into the music somehow,\" León said earlier this month of growing up by the ocean. The Miami native describes his compositions as spaces to inhabit rather than stories; a personal stamp strong enough to transform any output he lends his hand to, be that ambient (Gloria) or perreo heaters (Rompediskoteka).

A decade-plus later, \"Bikini\" comes alive in the shedding of those inhibitions: why hedge around the pool, when you could head straight for the sea?Despite \"Bikini\"'s deft movement between shifting rhythmic patterns, the track still manages to capture a profound sense of pause. Trying to make sense of the changing tides—\"Lookin' out there / Tryin' to find a meaning\"—de Casier only finds herself recentered \"with the wind in my hair, just breathing in the air.\" It's these atmospheric tendencies that take \"Bikini\" from the track of September to the track of the year. Before León and de Casier, artists from Otis Redding to Kelela have gazed \"out there,\" hoping to find some sort of solace in the meeting of water and sky.

The Belo Horizonte native's productions merge sparse electronic elements inspired by drill and trap with sluggish violins, pianos, flutes and timpani—all of which fill the air with a mysterious sensuality and ominous aura. Queridão, which translates to \"beloved\" from Portuguese, is a collection of tracks that has taken the producer from SoundCloud cult favourite to living legend in the rising funk mineiro scene of Belo Horizonte.The mountainous, landlocked city is widely celebrated for its slower and more melodic take on funk, but what sets Anderson apart is his commitment to downright eerie experimentalism, stripping down the sound's full-bodied elements to forge epic and radical restraint. It's really no wonder that Queridão stands out as some of the most enticingly abstract dance music of the year. - GG Albuquerque","/features/4404",2024,34,0,0],["Polygonia","Da Nao Tian Gong","Da Nao Tian Gong is Polygonia's most watched childhood film. Translating to \"Havoc in Heaven,\" the narrative links heaven to nature—from the peaches of immortality in the Heavenly Garden to Fruit Mountain. The Chinese-German artist has consistently sought out lessons from our environment, recently telling Resident Advisor: \"People should collaborate together in peace to save our planet.\"In 2024, Earth is increasingly heating up. Cities—and people—have been set alight. On Da Nao Tian Gong, Polygonia makes sense of this destruction through an effervescent mix of ambient, techno and downtempo, using the synthetic to recreate the organic, from a synth pad dawn chorus to the rhythmic hissing of water. Nestled at the heart of this sublime EP lies the simple yet powerful message of protecting our world. The peaches, the seeds, the roots. In a year of mass displacement, what could be more pertinent than that? - Vivian Yeung","/features/4404",2024,296,0,0],["Astrid Sonne","Great Doubt","Great Doubt is Astrid Sonne's first album as a singer-songwriter, but she's been using her voice for much longer. The Danish artist has spoken about her time spent in church choirs, acknowledging its role in shaping her vocals: \"I definitely wouldn't be singing as loud as I do.\" On Great Doubt, Sonne is definitely loud, producing immense emotional volume out of sparse arrangements.\"Do you wanna\" arrives with a straight but heavy drum beat as Sonne confesses, \"Do you wanna have a baby? / I really don't know.\" This unnervingly direct existentialism runs through the entire album, whether in the slow, booming 808s on \"Everything is unreal\" or the simple pizzicato viola on \"Almost.\" Sonne doesn't shy away from bold, unembellished statements, only augmenting the sense of intimacy (as on the plaintive, Ben Vince-assisted \"Say you love me\"). In daring to confront her deepest fears head-on, Sonne has made the year's most striking pop album. - Bella Aquilina","/features/4404",2024,1009,0,0],["Charli xcx","BRAT","For a decade, Charli xcx thrashed between two seemingly contradictory stations: pop sweetheart and cult icon. She lacquered finely tuned singles in industry-standard polish, then loaded brilliant, labyrinthine albums with dense lines about her deepest fears. With BRAT, she swung to please her niche—and ended up painting the summer radioactive green. Her most momentous album to date is a rare animal: a galvanising pop record all wound up for the club on one hand, a glistening smorgasbord of spilled guts on the other.By turning her insecurities inside out on songs like \"Sympathy is a knife\" and \"Girl, so confusing,\" then counterweighting those cerebations with the whole-body release of \"Von dutch\" and \"Club classics,\" Charli alchemised a new vision of her own success. She's long picked over the question of what it means to make it. BRAT homes in on something of an answer: there's no \"it\" to make.

On his second official collection of bubbling—a sped-up mutation of dancehall—Dutch-Surinamese producer De Schuurman builds on the genre's Afro-diasporic legacy with a clutch of tracks designed to whip up hysteria in the rave.\"Benniale Dakar\" starts with the ominous drama of an early Pop Smoke trap tune then launches into a rattling speed dembow. As smoky pads permeate the air, the beat decelerates into half-time—only a quick moment to gather your waist before the wine-inducing rhythms of \"Bubbling Meets Kaseko,\" which fuse bubbling's restless kicks with traditional Surinamese skratji percussion. On \"Stylez two,\" mischievous samples of Lil Jon's infamous \"OK!\" and KRS-One's \"Sound of da Police\" can jolt even the stiffest hips into work. When \"Scratchin\"'s pointillist synths plink around vocal samples of \"I'm just scratchin' the surface,\" you get the sense it's both a call to action and warning shot: Schuurman is here to stay. - Rachel Grace Almeida","/features/4404",2024,34,0,0],["Loidis","One Day","Not waving, or drowning, but drifting. That's how 2024 felt for many of us: a serotonin crash made all the more raw by an increasingly cruel world. After years of clubland electrifying the masses with the shock of the new, we chose to lean the other way, prioritising cosy records that made you thankful for what you already have (a craving that, in alternative circles, drew people to the spectral-jukebox transmissions of Cindy Lee like moth to flame). Into this climate landed a masterclass in softer vibrations from Brian Leeds, who, as Huerco S. and Pendant, has already proved himself a master of suspended animation several times over. One Day both encapsulated the mood and cut through it like a beacon.Does it augur poorly for a culture built on progression to take a step back and recalibrate? Well, the past was priced in; Loidis is the ancient name for Leeds, after all. And though One Day was built around slippery micro rhythms and delayed dub stabs, Leeds hardly soapboxed for a return to subtlety. The strongest promo was essentially happenstance, after he termed the project \"dub mnml emo tech\" to wriggle out of anything too formal, but wound up perfectly articulating its playful vibe.Just as For Those Of You…'s truncated loops were a creative sleight-of-hand, One Day pulls off a sly trick throughout. Leeds mimics the lossy compression and audio degradation favoured by the clicks 'n cuts set, only this time using stem separation software and creative resampling that falls closer, he told us, to hypermodern genres. In doing so, he created a shapeshifting palette: all muzzled kicks, panned basslines bobbing through hyaline textures and indulgent codas tacked onto nine- or ten-minute tunes (\"Why Do,\" \"Love's Linneaments,\" \"Sugar Snot\") that you could have sworn flashed by in four. It scans as wrong at first blush, so you're compelled to run it back a dozen times—by which point, naturally, it sounds exceptional.One Day doesn't just revitalise styles that faded from favour; it glows with the patience of Shinchi Atobe and DJ Sprinkles, the frolic of Isolée and Dinky, the 3 AM soul-searching of Claro Intelecto and Paul St. Hilaire. Most obviously, the spirit of Alcachofa and Vocalcity feel hardcoded into its DNA. These are records that have meant a lot to people over the years, made by artists who have stood the test of time. I'd be lying if I didn't think Leeds is in that conversation now.When it arrived, One Day might have seemed too discrete to break out, but months of compulsive listening have upended that. If we're resting at a waystation en route to a destination as-yet-unclear, there was no more generous or agreeable companion. So while there aren't many conclusions to be drawn from the discomforting haze of 2024, this much is true: the album that felt primed to take a slow stroll to classic status has raced way ahead of schedule. It's already there. - Gabriel Szatan","/features/4404",2024,188,0,0],["","Lara Sarkissian - Remnants","The Club Chai cofounder assembles fearsome drums and samples of Armenian film music into raw archival futurism.","/reviews/36233",2024,-1,1,0],["","CCL - Plot Twist","The DJ known for zipping between BPMs and tempos melts down psychedelic rave tropes into a dreamy, topsy-turvy adventure.","/reviews/36232",2024,-1,1,1],["","Madam X - Homecoming","Arriving over a decade into her career, Madam X's debut EP is every bit as bassy and banging as you might expect.","/reviews/36217",2024,-1,1,0],["","Tristan Arp - a pool, a portal","The Detroit artist explores themes of rewilding Earth through dexterous rhythms and gorgeous ambient dreamlands.\n","/reviews/36231",2024,-1,1,1],["","Fergus Jones - Ephemera","Formerly known as Perko, Fergus Jones crafts some of the classiest '90s and early aughts downtempo and ambient you'll hear this fall.Listen:Bandcamp","/features/4397",2024,149,0,0],["","Honey Dijon - DJ-Kicks: Honey Dijon","Honey Dijon's DJ-Kicks is an ecstatic house music history lesson, reaching the peaks and valleys of a mammoth rave set with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker.Listen:Bandcamp","/features/4397",2024,150,0,0],["","Two Shell - Two Shell","After years of tiring tricks and hijinx, Two Shell's first album is surprisingly, refreshingly and successfully clear.Listen:Bandcamp","/features/4397",2024,55,0,0],["","Snakeskin - They Kept Our Photographs","A year into the Palestinian crisis, the Lebanese duo reflect on the harrowing images on their screens with an album that reaches deep emotional depths by tempering dream pop's sweet-natured reverie with experimental snarl.Listen:Bandcamp","/features/4397",2024,151,0,0],["","Moin - You Never End","On their second album, the post-hardcore band bring vocalists into their enigmatic, abstract mould.

This was a deliberate choice, she explained, to have everything stripped back so audiences could see her—and hear her—for all she was. But up there, the blue lights around her dimmed, it was clear that her solitary figure also reflected her more bitter-than-sweet struggles against what she described as \"male stoicism.\" This remark came from the revelations she had while reading The Will to Change, an investigation of men, masculinity and love by the radical Black feminist scholar bell hooks. Her epiphany was painstakingly reflected in the dancehall derivation \"On The Run\": \"You get around enough / Too busy actin' tough / Give me a softer side / I won't wait all night.\" Patriarchal culture doesn't only hurt women, Kelela discovered—it also restricts the way men are able to explore intimacy and achieve wholeness for themselves.\n\nI saw Kelela perform in Berlin. 13 of Raven's 15 tracks were produced there, and it shows. There's a sorrow and solemnity woven into the city's monochromatic corners that echo through Raven, like a pebble rattling in an empty aluminium can. Even the title track is underpinned by a spacious yearning, as if on the brink of a breaking point—\"Took all my labour / Don't tell me that I'm strong,\" she sings, before gradually trotting into a heaving 4/4 beat, a subtle nod to clubbing as escapism. By the album's conclusion, \"Far Away,\" Kelela finds her deliverance in the form of honeyed ad-libs undulating over sounds of crashing waves, as if signalling that with enough time and perspective, all pain can be alchemised into pure spirit. -Whitney Wei","/features/4293",2023,86,0,0],["","Caroline Polachek - Desire I Want To Turn Into You","Diving headfirst into the delusion and madness that accompanies the all-consuming feeling of romantic and sexual passion, this unapologetically raw album leaves no stone unturned in its portrayal of emotional intensity. Through visceral lyrics that underline the idea of desire as a truly physical sensation, the ex-Chairlift vocalist sings of self-indulgent surrender to a lover without the slightest care of appearing desperate or needy. But it's the production—from Polachek and Danny L. Harle—that truly makes this a multifaceted pop record: feathery drum & bass, flamenco, dreamy rock and bassy R&B bops add to the physicality of Polachek's feelings, pushing her theatrical vocals outside of the shielded realm of inner thoughts and into the material world. -Nyshka Chandran\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify","/features/4293",2023,295,0,0],["","James Holden - Imagine This Is A High Dimensional Space Of All Possibilities","James Holden's music has always been otherworldly.

This all culminated with Imagine This Is A High Dimensional Space Of All Possibilities, which marks a welcome return to the club for Holden—or his version of it, anyway. Recognisable dance music tropes (hints of dub techno, echoes of house, microdoses of rave) nestle into the rich and complex instrumentation that gives all of Holden's music its distinctive flair.

On their latest LP of heart-tugging R&B, Levi's tough 808s and trilling piano sketches hold a steady, unrelenting pace while Tirzah pours her heart into 11 rough-and-ready love songs. All the familiar hallmarks of Tirzah are there—understated vocals and a sound rooted in \"disarming simplicity\"—but here everything is notched up to a new, more physical intensity. Each track packs a smouldering punch and Levi's distorted piano melodies on tracks like \"F22\" and \"Promises\" have Grand Cru earworm qualities. The album turns Tirzah and Levi's often ramshackle songs into a steamrolling train that tugs at the heartstrings all the harder, while still holding onto the lightweight feel that makes all of the project's music so enchanting. -Conor McTernan\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify","/features/4293",2023,190,0,0],["","Regal86 - La Onda","If there was one trend in techno to note this year—aside from \"fast\"—it was hardgroove, a taut and loopy style originally pioneered in the '90s and making one hell of a comeback on dance floors across the Americas and Europe in 2023. Regal86, a buzzy producer from Monterrey makes all kinds of music, but he's particularly good at hardgroove. His album La Onda landed at the perfect time to take the revival to the next level. With breathless sequencing and expert programming, this is hard, fast dance music that doesn't bludgeon you over the head, but instead invites you to dance and get lost in its intricacies. And with trip-hop breaks and clever interludes, La Onda works as an album through and through, recalling some '90s techno greats with real finesse. -Andrew Ryce\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify","/features/4293",2023,44,0,0],["","Overmono - Good Lies","Going from throwing makeshift parties deep in the woods to sold-out global tours, Overmono's ascent is long overdue.

The melodrama and introspection is still there, but on tracks like the thrilling \"Loading\" or the surging house of \"Fall Back,\" his words—and dextrous vocal chopping—gains a whole new power, especially when sandwiched between woozy ballads like \"Fire The Editor.\" In other words, it's the best of both worlds. -Andrew Ryce\n\nApple Music / Spotify","/features/4293",2023,1011,0,0],["","Mr. G - Pearls Don't Lay On The Shore","According to Mr. G, Pearls Don't Lay On The Shore is what happens when he makes music from the soul.

A special kind of self-assured ease in drifting into the unknown exists here. The Ancient Truth feels like a period of focused introspection, full of lush pads and pensive basslines, that reveals an inner world even more vast and mystical than how it first seems (just after the beat drops on the title track, a \"wake up, wake up\" chirps in the distance).

Fuzzy dub tones on \"Keep Safe\" and \"The Weather Man\" give way to chuggier cuts like \"In Door,\" with St. Hilaire's mesmeric vocals and streamlined basslines acting as key transition tools throughout.

Those particles are rearranged into gentle compositions that inhale and exhale like a living respiratory system, with melodies that appear like clouds on the horizon before rolling away and letting the music clear up again. Atlas takes the fearless compositional framework of past albums and her ear for slight-but-dazzling melodies and presents them in a new, almost neoclassical way.

The slow-burning LP unravels like a gentle love letter, pairing intuitive, staccato drums with conversational vocals and lush instrumentation (guitar and woodwinds). There are hints of jazz, trap and dub techno—perhaps a reference to batida's own cross-pollination from various Angolan and Portuguese styles—and a thread of tenderness and toughness.

Madres deftly combines house music with field recordings from indigenous communities, the Peruvian cajón drum, clips from a protest against homophobia and pan-Latin American rhythms.

With contributions from best-in-school producers such as Roza Terenzi, Sansibar, Maara, Priori and more, the compilation serves as a great reminder that the fruits of the '90s are still ripe for renovation (and innovation). -Bella Aquilina\n\nListen:\nBandcamp","/features/4293",2023,298,0,0],["","Brutalismus 3000 - ULTRAKUNST","Over the last two years, Brutalismus 3000 have become one of the biggest techno acts in Europe through sheer force of will and attitude. Their music, which they call \"anti-techno\" or \"nu-gabber-post-techno-punk\"—and they won't say it, but it's also kind of bloghouse—is confrontational but also funny. They channel the outlandish vibe of early electroclash acts and dress it up in an outfit thrifted from Humana that you might see walking down Warschauer Strasse on a Friday night. Tales of murder, excess and scene-baiting (\"Safe Space\") are soundtracked by short-circuiting electronics, making for a gleeful LP as giddy as it is confrontational, leaving a path of destruction and laughter in its wake. -Andrew Ryce\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music  / Spotify","/features/4293",2023,490,0,0],["","Mun Sing - Inflatable Gravestone","Inflatable Gravestone, the title of Mun Sing's debut album on Planet Mu, neatly summarises the fantastical world the Giant Swan cofounder operates in: a cold, hard symbol of death is turned into something squashy and playful. The music on Inflatable Gravestone folds listeners into that strange and wonderful land, like jumping on a bouncy castle that deflates and re-inflates without warning. The textures are intense (\"Squabble\"), the rhythms jolting, swerving and sometimes falling off into oblivion (\"Gliding\"). And it all ties together with an underlying absurdity (\"Spider\"). It's a place only a truly brilliant and off-kilter mind could conjure up. -Sophie McNulty\n\nListen:\nBandcamp","/features/4293",2023,51,0,0],["","Natural Wonder Beauty Concept - Natural Wonder Beauty Concept","On their self-titled debut album, Ana Roxanne and DJ Python aim to massage out the beauty in loneliness and alienation. Floating on tides of ambient synths, the duo employ emo rap, synth pop, lucid breakbeat and more to explore the substrates of deep connection and unspoken tenderness. Avant-garde instrumental flourishes seamlessly blend into metropolis-at-night atmospherics. Roxanne's ethereal singing plucks at every fibre of your being, while Python's intricate percussion arrangements are modulated until they begin to trickle like water. These two masters of contemplative, shoegazey electronica come together for a debut that lives up to its name and more. -Emeka Okonkwo\n\nListen:\nBandcamp","/features/4293",2023,835,0,0],["","Ciel - Homesick","The miracle of globalised contemporary electronic music is how artists have imprinted their own unique cultural identity into their productions. The stylistically and geographically roving debut album from Ciel is one such example, melding downtempo, ambient and electro. Ciel, who was born in Xi'an, China, and came of age in Toronto, based Homesick on eight types of traditional Chinese instruments, each of which correspond to the individual track titles. The most striking among them is the anxious tremble of \"Metal,\" interpolated between syncopated drums, and \"Silk,\" all sly chimes and rotund basslines. Conceptually rich, Homesick embroiders the disparate textures of Ciel's Eastern home and her Western world into one elegant tapestry. -Whitney Wei\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify","/features/4293",2023,312,0,0],["","Pangaea - Changing Channels","Festival FOMO moment of 2023? It's gotta be Ben UFO unleashing Pangaea's \"Bad Lines\" at Dekmantel. The happy hardcore-inspired anthem was the coda to the UK artist's short but magnificently sweet album, Changing Channels, which nailed the hard-to-wrangle cocktail of silly yet classy. In one fell swoop, Pangaea wrote the tune of the summer, doffed his cap to the hardcore continuum and poked fun at dance music's current obsession with speed and neon sounds—all with a massive smile on his face. -Carlos Hawthorn\n\nListen:\nBandcamp","/features/4293",2023,10,0,0],["","K-Lone - Swells","Swells dropped on July 7th, a few days before I made my annual pilgrimage to Love International festival. In Tisno, the sea sparkles, the air is hot and the buzz of the cicadas in the trees is omnipresent. I listened to the glossy ripples of K-Lone's second album as I lay by the water, felt the sun on my skin and closed my eyes to allow my body to recover from the night before—the setting was just right. There are a couple dance floor-leaning tracks on the LP (\"Love Me A Little,\" \"Gel\"), but Swells is largely made up of elastic tunes that slip, slide and undulate like the lapping of waves on a shoreline. Eliza Rose's vocal appears in hazy manipulations throughout (most notably on woozy R&B cut \"With U\"), accompanying colourful tones, melodies that glimmer and chords that melt into each other. -Katie Thomas\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify","/features/4293",2023,69,0,0],["","Deena Abdelwahed - Jbal Rrsas","Tunisian artist Deena Abdelwahed has a predilection for pulling sonic touchpoints from the MENA region and dissolving them into dense, at times confrontational, productions.

It's a stunner of jagged synth lines that, in spite of its influences, feels like an electronic cousin to doom metal riffs. \"Six As Oil\" is just as intrepid. Abdelwahed slings around a fugue of subterranean drones, sustained sirens and tight snares to make for a deliciously anti-authoritarian rallying cry. -Whitney Wei\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify","/features/4293",2023,1014,0,0],["","Oceanic - Choral Feeling","Why do we sing? It remains one of the great mysteries of human evolution. But to open your mouth, vibrate your vocal chords and produce musical tones through exalting air is at the core of being human. To do so in unison with others is a tradition that can be traced back time immemorial. On his debut album, Oceanic reimagines choral music for the 21st century, chopping, warping and distorting the voices of 30 friends to create Choral Feeling. Equal parts odd and profound, the vocals are often distorted beyond recognition, whether drawn out into haunting melodies or woven into drum patterns through syncopated rhythms. Oberman stays true to choral music's antiquated roots, producing a capacious vision of human connection, one that is mysterious, kaleidoscopic and fundamentally beautiful. -Bella Aquilina\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify","/features/4293",2023,212,0,0],["","Fever Ray - Radical Romantics","Fever Ray's third album is probably the closest that Karin Dreijer's solo project has come to sounding like The Knife, and that's no bad thing.

Where Dreijer's past work has revelled in alien unintelligibility, Radical Romantics puts its journey of self-discovery, emotion and passion out there for everyone to see, in all its pseudo-tropical, plastic-palm-tree and artificial beach glory. -Andrew Ryce\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify","/features/4293",2023,511,0,0],["","Purelink - Signs","Signs, the stunning debut album from Chicago trio Purelink, occupies a nook all of its own in the broad realm of chill-out music—too feathery to be IDM, yet too alert to be ambient.

How does one constantly evolve and meet—even surpass—their best work? Leon Vynehall seems to know the answer. Since 2018's powerful conceptual album Nothing Is Still, the UK musician has matured from a talented club producer into a storyteller par excellence, weaving original and compelling narratives through sound. 2019's RA-recommended DJ-Kicks was one of the best mixes that year. Now, in 2022, he's charted again.\n\nLike DJ-Kicks, fabric presents Leon Vynehall is all about dynamics, except this time the focus is on the club. You'd think that might be restrictive, but Vynehall is a master at finding common threads and energies in disparate musical worlds. Here, work by Mala, A2, Or:la, Ehua, Lady Blacktronika, Commodo, Hagan, Skee Mask and textures from so many other producers hang together in a smoky, soulful soup.

He tours all the time, but still finds time to write a regular newsletter about everything going on around him. As a DJ he exudes enthusiasm, playing groovy records that run the gamut from sleek contemporary tech house to old school Italo classics. This live recording from Dimensions captures his range perfectly: he starts low and slow, but just as things get a bit heady, he makes a U-turn with the outrageous vocal track \"Adventure\" by Eleanor and Shep Pettibone. From there, things dart between the cerebral and the cheesy. Vintage hip house gives way to G-funk-laced electro and acid before dissipating into celestial techno and old school rave.

His HÖR Berlin mix from January this year perfectly encapsulates this style. Minimal yet replete with understated hooks, it layers psychedelic flurries of toms with tribal drums, house vocals and trancey melodic fills.

With its disarming atmospherics, Villain's fourth full-length has nothing to declare—only quiet intensities to whisper. -W.W.\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud","/features/4077",2022,77,0,0],["","Waajeed - Memoirs Of Hi-Tech Jazz","Waajeed's debut on the prestigious Tresor label is a tribute to his hometown of Detroit, as a rousing tribute to both Black leisure and resistance against oppression. Conceptualised with a mini road trip around the Motor City—specifically, from the his own Underground Music Academy to Belle Isle—Memoirs Of Hi-Tech Jazz connects the dots between Detroit's rich musical traditions, encompassing jazz, deep house, minimal techno and marching band music. Even the title, a reference to the Underground Resistance subgroup Galaxy 2 Galaxy, reflects Detroit's storied sonic lineage. Proud, joyous and unapologetically local, Waajeed's love letter to his hometown is packed with velvety tones and lustrous chords that acknowledge the past and pave the way for the future. -N.C.\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud","/features/4077",2022,28,0,0],["","Marina Herlop - Pripyat","Do you ever wonder how the world looks through a baby's eyes?

Where the Catalan artist's first two records showed off her expert piano playing and freeform, wordless vocals, Pripyat goes a step further into the unknown, patching together her classical training with dissonant electronics, and even weaving in an ancient Indian singing style called konnakol.

On this meteorology-themed album, James did away with her club sound completely to write a series of ambient tracks distinguished by a worn, melancholy beauty. Here, intermittent rain is depicted as a flurry of lustrous synths, \"14°C\" is transformed into pensive arpeggios—the playfully jagged IDM she's revered for—and sounds hiccup and stop-start across placid pads all over the LP.

There's a light, almost weightless, feel to this 11-track LP as the Tokyo composer and producer shows off his mastery of twinkling chords, spacey disco grooves, vintage synth patterns and video game sounds. Asakusa Light is relatively sparse—even its big-room tracks like \"Bamboo Fighter\" feature relatively minimal arrangements—which allows his signature melodies to really shine.

Fear Of Programming is loaded with bold, bassy techno and arresting ambient passages. The real gold is in the hooks, which the spartan but still powerful production emphasizes like a gold frame around a masterpiece painting.

With expertly curated vocal collaborations that reflect on family and faith, elements of gqom, amapiano and highlife, Textures is a transportive ode to the drumming continent, and the meaning of growing up both within and away from it. One moment you're in a lush, jungly landscape, the next you're hustling in the streets of Accra.

But the melodies are bigger, the drums are heavier and, most importantly, the tracks are separate, each with its own hook, its own uniquely staggered rhythm.

Björk has been making music for over three decades now, and with each record she steps into mystical, uncharted territory, creating work which is ever more beguiling, more avant-garde and always, somehow, even more Björk. On Fossora, Björk sings with a sweeping gravitas over rich woodwinds and distorted gabber beats, the additional instrumentation dancing around her vocal as she muses on the circle of life, nature and her own late mother. Digging her fingers into the earth, Björk unknots tributaries of tangled roots, the crashing drum patterns and complex textures representing the stark, breathtaking topography of her homeland. -Katie Thomas\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud","/features/4077",2022,63,0,0],["","Huerco S. - Plonk","From the first three seconds of Plonk, you know Huerco S. isn't doing the misty ambient thing again.

Written to accompany an experimental video game about Scotland leaving the union, Escapology operates along a dual axis, at once anxious—filled with eerie bits of sci-fi chatter and dense layers of swelling feedback—but also hopeful, at least when he turns to club tracks. \"Uncoil,\" for example, is a pearl half-covered in sand somewhere between drum & bass and footwork, while \"Cross The Gap\" uses the negative space of dub to create something glimmering in the weight of the darkness around it. -Henry Ivy\n\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify","/features/4077",2022,33,0,0],["","DJ Lag - Meeting With The King","After years pushing the Durban scene and helping to make the sound a global sensation, anticipation for DJ Lag's debut album, Meeting With The King, was sky-high.

Meeting With The King takes the moody sonics of the gqom—born from township house parties—and makes it polished, opulent, even melodic, honouring the origins of the sound while adding catchy elements of amapiano, house, Afrotech and more.

Sicko was an integral part of their healing journey as a survivor. There's palpable catharsis written into the energetic pulse of the album, which bleeds several genres into a satisfyingly cohesive mix that makes it difficult to discern where one song ends and another begins. Ambient sequences with knotty sections that twinkle and flutter turn into spaced out dub and then, somewhere along the way, listeners are transported to post-punk-leaning IDM.

Nope, there's none. It's all tune for tune,\" Theo Parrish said outside the familiar NTS stall in Dalston's Gillett Square. And he doesn't just talk to talk. Many DJs claim to play across genres, but there are \"many DJs\" and then there is Theo Parrish. Over the past few years, the historically private artist has given fans a near-unprecedented view into his creative mind, first with the lengthy and unclassifiable sonic essay-meets-radio drama We Are All Georgeous Monsterss, and then this year with a six-and-a-half hour mix for NTS called \"Eargoggles.\" (Parrish also dropped another six-hour mix close to press time.) \n\nEargoggles is a marathon celebration of the infinite diversity of Black music, spanning from hard bop to hip-hop, searing psych rock to roots reggae. No random grab bag, this is a grand narrative and the revelation of a modern canon of soul with appearances by James Brown, The Congos and D'Angelo. The mix is an education unto itself—around hour five Parrish drops \"Jazz Cats Part 1,\" a cut consisting of Madlib breathlessly laying out his key jazz influences—yet it's also a generous statement of purpose bursting with joy and urgency.\n\n25 years into his career, Parrish gives us an exhaustive guide to the music that makes him tick, that has informed his own enduring classics. But why now? He explains the gravity of his convictions in the final moment of the magisterial \"Eargoggles\" mix:\n\nI'm hoping that at some point during this... After you've had a ride, a musical ride with me, that you take a moment to consider the troubles that you have, and consider that you're lucky to have them.\n\nEven if it doesn't affect you demographically, you should seriously consider the fact that there's an urgency that should be lived, in respect for those that get taken from us early under the guise of 'serve and protect.'\n\nSo let's survive together. But let's remember them together as well. Let's not forget how we treat each other when the music's playing and how things change when the lights go on and we all go back to the rest of our lives.\n\nLet's go back with a little more urgency and care for the fellow man. Let's give a damn a little bit.

Though Sweeney has since brought Beats In Space back via Apple Music, last March he unexpectedly wrapped up his term on WNYU with episode #1085. Listeners flooded the comment section on a YouTube livestream after the news broke, thanking him for his illustrious tenure. For the finale, Sweeney played Beats In Space classics that highlighted the show's connection to the history of New York City dance music, dropping in an eclectic selection from Alicia Myers, Chaz Jankel and Arnold Jarvis.

From established acts like Vigro Deep and Gaba Canal to upstarts like Teno Afrika, the Shannen SP and Joe Cotch-curated collection demonstrates the inherent mid-tempo sensuality of amapiano, the thrilling sound of a generation of artists discovering their powerful collective voice. —Matt McDermott\n\nListen:\nSpotify / Soundcloud","/features/3950",2021,1040,0,0],["","Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders & The London Symphony Orchestra - Promises","Reading over the personnel for Promises, one might expect a grandiose statement—a multigenerational spiritual jazz odyssey for the ages. Instead, Sam Shepherd and the legendary Pharoah Sanders show a staggering knack for subtlety. Building upon a searching motif of four seven-note chords, both Shepherd and Sanders play with extraordinary humility. The careful arrangements serve as a backdrop for Sanders' restrained sax soloing, but the record doesn’t headline one artist over the other. Instead it reaches for an ineffable oneness, the pinnacle of improvised exploration. Each gradual change feels monumental, like the spaced-out synth exploration on \"Movement 7\" or the Hammond organ passed through a vibrating Leslie speaker on \"Movement 8.\" That Promises holds its own—and even stands out—within one of the most important catalogues in jazz is a remarkable achievement. —M.M.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify","/features/3950",2021,915,0,0],["","DJ Manny - Signals In My Head","2021 was a golden year for footwork. This year, Planet Mu, once responsible for thrusting the Chicago genre onto the international stage in the mid-'10s, put out a trilogy of releases from stalwarts of this syncopated world: Jana Rush, RP Boo and DJ Manny. On Manny's contribution, the veteran Chicago-born, Brooklyn-based artist sought to bring romance to a genre historically known for soundtracking dance battles. If anyone could step up to this challenge, it would be DJ Manny and his smooth production style. Signals In My Head sees him whipping up some of the most airy atmospheres footwork has ever seen. Rosy melodies swirl into delirium while R&B vocals coo, sometimes lustfully and other times longingly, mellowing out its characteristically rougher rhythms and leaving only traces of a harder past.—Kiana Mickles\n                \nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud","/features/3950",2021,51,0,0],["","Dean Blunt - Black Metal 2","Dean Blunt has long been an elusive character, quietly releasing oblique albums without liner notes and responding to interview questions in riddles. His entire body of work could be viewed like a museum of intriguing abstract paintings, open to interpretation but always astonishing. His most recent record riffs on its predecessor's Americana themes—heart-tugging strings, whining harmonica, desert rock guitar and somber and occasionally tongue-in-cheek lyrics that allude to loss, betrayal and the white critic's flimsy observations. But with the help of Joanne Robertson's girlish voice, as if brought down straight from heaven, Black Metal 2 emerges as one of Blunt's most approachable records. —K.M.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud","/features/3950",2021,856,0,0],["","Tirzah - Colourgrade","If Tirzah's breakout debut album Devotion was beloved for its intimate romantic love songs, the tracks on Colourgrade will be remembered for expanding the definition of what constitutes a love song in the first place. Moving out of the city and giving birth to two children, Tirzah examined other forms of love, like the camaraderie between creative partners or the bond between parent and child. Some tracks here make it difficult to parse whether she is referring to a lover, a relative or an old childhood friend, but the universality of it all makes Colourgrade a record that will age gracefully with repeated listens. Adding to its introspective beauty and warmth, the album is brought to life with grainy production and endearing imperfections (a cough here, incomprehensible whispers there). Charmingly unpolished and grounded in a human need we can all agree on—love—it's an album that encourages listeners to cherish life's smallest, most precious moments. —K.M.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud","/features/3950",2021,190,0,0],["","HTRK - Rhinestones","People rarely talk about their favourite \"band\" anymore. HTRK, the Australian duo comprising Jonnine Standish and Nigel Yang, are one of a handful of groups that inspire this level of dedication in their fans. Their music holds similar qualities to other classic \"favourite bands,\" like The Cure—their songs microcosms of ineffable longing and desolation. On their latest LP Rhinestones, HTRK continue to embrace stripped-down guitars, this time going for a twang and effects palette that evokes the Kodachrome skies of Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas. In the film, the sprawling vistas and stark photography set the stage for a hushed, heartbreaking drama. Here, the sparse guitar and unhurried progressions serve a similar purpose, foregrounding Standish's languid vocals.  As usual, deceptively simple lines like\"If you wanted to / Hang out with mе during the day,\" on \"Sunlight Feels Like Bee Stings,\" hit like a brick. —M.M.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify","/features/3950",2021,1041,0,0],["","Joy Orbison - still slipping vol. 1","Long gone is the Joy Orbison who only makes club bangers. In his place sits a producer whose music is, with every new release, a truer, more vivid expression of not only his ever-broader tastes, but also his life and loves. Building on recent experiments with R&B and downtempo music, still slipping vol. 1 incorporates voice notes from his family—asking Joy how he's doing, making jokes, talking about weed brownies—into a cosy world of tunes that range from sedate garage to hooky, subdued pop. It feels like a Sunday afternoon in Joy's living room: vinyl all over the floor, loved ones popping in and out and talented friends occasionally jumping on the mic, all culminating into a more relaxed look at one of UK dance music's most quietly virtuosic producers.—Carlos Hawthorn\n\nListen:\n\nBandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music","/features/3950",2021,0,0,0],["","Mr. Mitch - Lazy","It can take artists years—decades, even—to be able to authentically express themselves through their music. Mr. Mitch said this personal change occurred around the release of his 2017 album, Devout, a vulnerable record inspired by fatherhood. Not coincidentally, it was also the first time his fans had truly embraced his experimentations with slower tempos, ornate instrumentation and song-oriented structures. The Londoner built on this newfound freedom and confidence on this year's Lazy, with 11 tracks packing a range of energies and emotions. There are heart-rending tributes to his own musician father and strong statements about racism and social justice (the title is a reference to stereotypes about Black people), blending not only genres but personal and political messages in a way that could have felt forced and overblown in less accomplished hands. Instead, one feels profoundly moved. —C.H.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud","/features/3950",2021,919,0,0],["","Loraine James - Reflection","The late and great Mark Fisher feared that musical ingenuity was being replaced by desperate revivalism in the dying embers of late capitalism.

James' mesmerising neo-IDM classic gestures towards dance music or bedroom R&B, only to take sudden detours into terra incognito that eludes categorisation altogether. (Nothing feels more appropriate than the outro being titled \"We're Building Something New.\") Sludgy, off-kilter kicks thud under pensive chords like some alien life form's interpretation of dance music. At times heartbreaking, at others startlingly vulnerable, James contemplates pandemic-era existentialism, projecting anxieties about the future with a ghostly delivery that feels like inner monologues being broadcast for all to hear: \"This is a reflection / Just mine, not yours.\" —E.O\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music  / Soundcloud","/features/3950",2021,33,0,0],["","Arushi Jain - Under The Lilac Sky","Arushi Jain has a buzzy, larger-than-life personality, but you'd hardly know that from her restrained and gentle music.

On her second full-length, she captures the evening light in all its ever-changing glory, moving from sunset to darkness. Humming synths and drones conjure the flickering shadows of twilight, while her voice adds bursts of vivid colour.

True to their jazz roots, the group of rotating musicians—led by DJ and multi-instrumentalist Cesar Toribio—start the record as improvisational jams before narrowing down a vision and a concept. Their live approach is tangible: several tracks start on simple refrains before morphing into full-bodied flurries of dreamy funk, Afro-Latin percussion and downtempo beats.

Thanks to him and peers like Binh and DJ Masda, overlooked corners of house, techno, electro, trance and breakbeat history are now prime influences for a burgeoning audience of DJs and producers, many of whom might not have formerly paid mind to the so-called \"minimal\" scene from which those DJs emerged. This mix from Phonotheque—home base for Lutz, DJ Koolt and the rest of the Montevideo techno scene—shows things are coming full circle. More than ever, Lutz is playing new music that his sound has directly influenced. He's also reaching for records that fit into his taste bracket but come from sources you might not expect. It would've been unusual a few years ago that he'd play something by, say, Overmono. It speaks to how different parts of dance music are coming ever closer into orbit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheo Parrish\nWe Are All Gorgeous Monsterss\n\nTheo Parrish's We Are All Georgeous Monsterss is more than a DJ mix: it's a casually delivered manifesto. In the fever pitch of the largest protest movement in US history, Parrish uploaded, revised and eventually pulled down an expansive six-part set that drew direct connections between racial violence and the appropriation of electronic dance music from its Black roots. \"You don't know what this music means to us, you only know what it means to you,\" Parrish intoned. \"Now granted, you take your ideas, you run with it, you create your own shit, that's great, you create your own universe of it. Please, go right ahead, there's nothing wrong with being inspired, but my god, you can't have all of it!\" Quotes and archival interviews break up Parrish's own spoken word as he unfurls hours of unreleased material, spanning from melancholy jazz piano to frenetic beat tracks. All the while, the Detroit artist detailed various indignities, from being pulled over to getting kicked off the decks at Berghain. If this is what Parrish, a massively respected innovator within the form, faces day-to-day, what does that say about the general experience of Black artists within the club scene?

The series was historically important, hosting mixes from Galcher Lustwerk and Ben UFO that stood the test of time. But the series also helped migrate the concept of DJing away from the utilitarian and towards the deeply personal. CCL's contribution to 111—the seven mixes that sent BUTW out on a high note—fit the bill. Kent described the set, which spanned from dream pop to dubstep, as \"a beautiful collage that feels like the reason I started the series in the first place.\" Akash pulled together a wistful 30-minute set of Bollywood tunes for 111, complementing Chris SSG's masterful three-hour ambient set and Dr Banana's moody garage and 2-step mix, to name just a few. BUTW felt like a natural home for all of these disparate styles, and this freedom often led to mixes worth cherishing. Kent's now moved on from BUTW, focusing on Mana Records, the label he runs with Andrea Zarza, but with any luck, BUTW's boundless approach will persevere.","/features/3789",2020,-1,0,0],["","Theo Parrish","Theo Parrish\nWe Are All Gorgeous Monsterss\n\nTheo Parrish's We Are All Georgeous Monsterss is more than a DJ mix: it's a casually delivered manifesto.

Summerhill, in the shimmering track \"I Dream So Loud.\" \"I've seen dreams deferred / As many times as I've seen kids wish upon them…. Now / Not later but right now / More than ever I dream so loud.\" In the next track, we hear a one-off vocal sample: \"Can't we rebel or something?\" Those words stay in our head as we listen to the rich, unpredictable, deeply personal mix that follows.\n\nThe beauty of DJing is you can play literally whatever you want, something that Josey Rebelle, a DJ since the age of 13, understands more deeply than most. Josey In Space, the second official mix in Tim Sweeney's Beats In Space series, has the same eclectic flex as her club and radio sets, drawing an arc from '90s hardcore to chilled UK hip-hop via house, techno, acid and jungle. But it's also highly focussed, bringing together these disparate sounds to give us something carefully considered: a paean to Black club music over the last few decades, from both sides of the Atlantic. \n\n\"Yes, music is beautiful, it makes you happy,\" Rebelle told Chal Ravens this year in a cover story for DJ Mag. \"But it's also a serious business, and you approach those decks with serious intentions to destroy the dance floor.\" Here, Rebelle's intentions are less dance floor destruction, more musical storytelling. But the dedication to craft is no less intense. Arriving one year after the BBC's #1 Essential Mix of 2019, Josey In Space once again shows Rebelle to be one of her generation's best.","/features/3789",2020,-1,0,0],["","Josey Rebelle","Josey Rebelle\nJosey In Space \nBeats in Space Records","/features/3789",2020,-1,0,0],["","Mix of the year","","/features/3789",2020,-1,0,0],["","Eris Drew Fluids Of Emotion  Interdimensional Transmissions","When \"Fluids Of Emotion\" came out in February, Matt Unicomb's review asked, \"Could this be the house record of the year?\" Eris Drew's track makes a strong case for the title, all psychedelic breakbeat house with the same feeling of controlled chaos you get from her quick-fingered mixing of old rave records.

Asmara sculpts an undulating backing track out of music from Aphex Twin, Suzanne Kraft & Jonny Nash and Kareem Lotfy—artists that have helped define the recent era of ambient music. Kelela's airy, improvised vocals act are the perfect counterpart to Jaco Pastorius' genius bass solo and Iury Lech's emotional washes. They bring this floating, beatless music to an unforgettable climax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLena Willikens & Vladimir Ivkovic\nLive: Nuits Sonores 2019\n\nHeadlining festival sets don't always work outside the original setting—as with well-timed jokes, you kinda had to be there. But leave it to Lena Willikens and Vladimir Ivkovic to make their three-hour Nuits Sonores odyssey suit nearly any context. It's meditative, weird and, lest we forget the main room dance floor it soundtracked, banging. Filled with the pair's characteristic slower selections, this mix feels like swimming inside a crystal ball. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCL\nUnsound Podcast 56\n\nCCL called this mix a \"regurgitated memory\" of their Honcho Campout set, reflecting on the \"more twisted hours… before the light had come up.\" That predawn unpredictability is what's so exciting here. One highlight is their adept pulling back with Codek's \"Closer\" before diving into a Metalheadz Wax Doctor rush. With these unreal transitions, and touches like the experimental Polish music that bookends the mix (a nod to Unsound) CCL shows the careful craft that sets them apart. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruly Madly\nGHOSTCAST 006\n\nGhostcast, a mix series from Berlin's favourite record store on wheels, has only released a few recordings since launching two years ago, but each is a window into a world of deep-digging DJs with exquisite house and techno collections. Truly Madly is one of them. An underground favourite who's steadily gaining recognition outside the world of trainspotters and Discogs geeks, the Londoner's set traverses classic techno, electro and house, cloaked with the same spacey charm that colours his club sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoards Of Canada\nSocietas x Tape (NTS x Warp 30)\n\nBoards Of Canada are two of the most reclusive artists in electronic music, which means we don't know much about what they listen to during long stays in the Scottish countryside. Their Societas x Tape mix, a two-hour set broadcast on NTS as part of Warp's 30th anniversary, gives us an idea. Obscure electronics by Filmmaker, '80s post-punk by Killing Joke and synth-pop from Severed Heads tell us a little bit more about these pioneers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDee Diggs\nFACT Mix 710\n\nNew York's Dee Diggs is on a quest to remind everyone that dance music is black music. Her FACT mix is her fiery mission statement, cutting through the history of black dance music, from Paris Is Burning and vintage acts like DJ Deeon and Karizma to NYC's new guard, including upstarts like Devoye and AceMo. This mix is classic, soulful and banging in all the right places, securing Diggs' own place in the canon she's charting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEris Drew\nRaving Disco Breaks Vol. 1\n\nOn this year's funkiest mixtape, Eris Drew made some of dance music's most classic sounds her own. Raving Disco Breaks is composed of dance classics chopped into breaks on-the-fly by the American DJ, showcasing not only her impressive technical skills but also the emotional, spiritual and often nostalgic flair that makes her sets so electrifying. It's old-school technique with a new-school vibe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco Del Garda\nRobert Johnson Archive 0002\n\nFrancesco Del Garda played this set at Robert Johnson on the banks of the Rhine a few days after Christmas last year. He couldn't have asked for a better setting: sun rising, perfect soundsystem, six-hour time slot, festive crowd. This recording, an edition of the Frankfurt club's new mix series, gives us only an hour of it, but it shows Del Garda on fire, indulging the uplifting sound that distinguishes him from his contemporaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatu\nTruancy Volume 240\n\nBatu describes his Truancy mix as the closing set for a \"festival in 2030 called Bristol-Bass.\" Given his Timedance label and his own inventive productions, he's in a good position to imagine the future of UK dance music. The mix’s backbone wiggles and booms with modern bass music, while making adventurous jumps from Latin and Afro-Caribbean rhythms to ambient techno and experimental club.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErika\nIT.podcast.s08e01\n\nErika's Interdimensional Transmissions podcast from March really lives up to the Detroit label's name: it sounds like you're hearing an actual transmission from another dimension. IT does down-the-rabbithole techno better than anyone, and this recording of Erika at an LA showcase for sister label Eye Teeth shows the sound at its cosmic, funky, head-spinning best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDJ Persuasion\nDedicated To The Dedicated 94-95\n\nAsk any junglist worth their salt: 1994 and '95 were the golden years. Disagree? Well, you might feel differently after listening to Dedicated To The Dedicated 94-95, the latest hour-long mix by '90s dance music fanatic DJ Persuasion, AKA Semtek. Every tune, most of them near-impossible to track down, writhes with rhythm and soul. The warm basslines and time-stretched vocals spark tingles of euphoria. When people say the '90s were better, this is the kind of thing they're thinking of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSherelle\nLDN: Bass & Percs Special\n\nEarlier this year, Sherelle's debut Boiler Room session—a whirlwind of footwork, jungle and grime—went viral. While it's easy for some high BPM DJs to tire out their audience, her set maintains an addictive high energy throughout, with explosive, playful transitions that sparked the dance music equivalent of a mosh pit. Wait for the gutsy rewind at 23:40 that shot her to instant (and deserved) fame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeif\nFreerotation 2019\n\nLeif is part of a small group of DJs whose yearly sets at Freerotation festival in Wales always feel like a big deal. 2019 was no exception. In this recording, Leif redefines the peak-time set, starting slow and spindly before moving gracefully through many shades of cosy, rhythmic club music. There are tunes by Equiknoxx and Domu, Efdemin and Aphex Twin, all stitched together with extraordinary skill. As one SoundCloud commenter put it: \"are you even human.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Rubinstein\nPhonica Mix Series 56\n\nDr. Rubinstein is like an acid historian, wading through decades of dance music history to find the best 303 lines ever put to wax. Yet she still finds time in her Phonica mix to highlight several up-and-coming talents (Jack Roland, Gian) alongside more familiar names (DMX Krew, Adapta). Sometimes dark, sometimes bright, Phonica Mix Series 56 was a deeply psychedelic trip, weaving excellent electro and techno between forgotten acid bombs. As always with Rubinstein, the mixing was world-class, each transition bringing us further into her unique sound world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeon Vynehall\nDJ-Kicks\n\nLast year, Leon Vynehall released Nothing Is Still, showing the world that his production chops extended way beyond the club. In 2019 he did something similar, but with DJing. His proof this time is a spellbinding DJ-Kicks mix, which blends genres, eras and moods together with sublime flow and dexterity. Dancehall, techno, pop, jungle, soul, a solo piano piece—what could've been a hot mess ends up as one of the classiest mix CDs in recent memory. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nre:ni\nDekmantel Podcast 253\n\nre:ni's Dekmantel podcast does everything right. The tracklist left the sleuths at mixesdb mostly stumped. The mixing is inspired, moving swiftly through tempos and styles with quick sleights of hand and extended blends. More than anything, though, its re:ni's ineffable sense of groove—slinky, fluid, always in flux—that makes this one really pop off. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurtle Bugg\nHNYPOT 330: African Art of Acid (Triple A Baybee) Mixx\n\nTurtle Bugg's Honey Soundsystem mix makes a point so simple it often goes unsaid: black people invented acid house. And yet, as he puts it, \"There was no Second Summer Of Love in Amerikkka, no Ibiza for Negroes to spend their holiday, no beginnings of a multi-million dollar industry that could change the lives of Lady Liberty's bastard children.\" The voices of Dave Chappelle, Malcolm X and Derrick May ring out over interlocking acid lines. The message is clear: black ingenuity thrives, no matter who is paying attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen UFO\nHessle Audio - 9th September 2019\n\nWhat makes this Hessle Audio show, one of many hosted by Ben UFO in 2019, so special? Well, it just is. On that early autumn night, armed with a stack of fresh wax, the UK DJ was on particularly impressive form, treating regulars and first-timer listeners to a beautifully woven tapestry of ambient, Afro techno, jungle and Joe. When it aired, it wasn't just nerds and ravers listening, either—Four Tet, Hunee, John Talabot and other dance music dons had all tuned in for their weekly dose of musical inspiration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVia App\nCrack Mix 307\n\nVia App taps into the elemental energy of Brooklyn's techno underground on this mix for Crack, a set as volatile as any of their recent productions. This bumpy ride through jarring turns and interruptions, with its snarling, punkish spirit, hit harder than most other mixes we heard this year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/reviews/23502\">Powder In Space by Powder</a>\n\n\n\n\nPowder\nPowder In Space\n\nYou play Powder In Space once. You think, \"This is nice.\" You leave it for a while, then play it a second and third time. You notice things like the Roy Brooks vocal, or Daphne's bubbling vibraphone melody, that you didn't catch the first time. You also realize you've fallen in love with it. This is how Powder's mix gets under your skin: her unobtrusive approach, drawn from offbeat house with gorgeous textures, waits for you to come around to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShannen SP\nDISCWOMAN 80\n\nAlongside Kode9, Shannen SP runs Hyperdub's Ø events at London's Corsica Studios, a wonderful monthly midweek showcase of experimental music and art. She's quickly become a DJ to watch, and this mix for Discwoman showcases her knack for linking together sharp, angular beats with loose percussive rhythms—a style she sums up as \"witchy black energy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCiel\nFACT Mix 724\n\nCindy Li's FACT mix has a specific concept: \"fast & light,\" inspired by hummingbirds. It also captures what makes her DJing so dynamic. The Toronto artist makes breakbeat, electro and techno float like feathers on the breeze, moving through quick-footed drum patterns and fluttering melodies with finesse. Her technique changes the feel of the music itself, which is among the highest compliments you can pay a DJ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Therapy\nLive: Honcho Campout 2019\n\nThe Way In may have had the freakiest sounds at this year's Honcho Campout. Hours before CCL brought the dance floor to tears with Beat Happening, Physical Therapy unfurled this masterclass in trippy eclecticism. Cuts of perfectly dreamy drum & bass, a slo-mo version of Cece Peniston's \"Finally\" layered over Stenny’s \"Stress Test,\" Andrew Weatherall's remix of St Etienne, D'Angelo's \"Devil's Pie\"—the highlights in this one are simply too many to name. From a punter's perspective, hearing a DJ with such unique style going for it like this is basically as good as it gets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJosey Rebelle\nEssential Mix\n\n\"The thread that runs through the music I play, and my whole life, comes from my parent's generation,\" Josey Rebelle told us in 2017's Real Scenes: London film. Her parents are part of the Windrush generation, which arrived in the UK from the Caribbean in the 1950s and went on to make an inestimable impact on British life and culture. Rebelle's heritage pours out the speakers every time she's behind the decks. She's a quintessential London DJ: informed by the city's record shop and soundsystem culture, she's comfortable weaving together soul, techno, house, disco, R&B and jungle. Her first Essential Mix was dark and funky, with deep US music from Jamal Moss and Aybee featuring alongside London favourites Steven Julien and Cooly G.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAriel Zetina\nTruancy Volume 249\n\n\"Power to them sexy transsexuals out there, transforming the world,\" a woman intones in the opening moments of Ariel Zetina’s Truancy mix. It's one of many vivid vocal samples that contribute to the smartbar resident's sense of narrative. Beneath them, trippy acid house and soulful techno—much of it produced by other queer and trans artists—paint different moods. Sometimes it's raw and sexy, other times meditative and strange, but always charged with attitude and passion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJackie House\nHNYPOT 300: Half A Bar Will Do It\n\nJackie House's \"Half A Bar Will Do It\" mix came out 11 months ago, in that post-New Year's, deep-winter stretch of time when dance music in the Northern Hemisphere briefly goes into hibernation. It matches that mood perfectly, easing, over the course of three hours, through soothing, low-energy grooves of all kinds, from Kompakt deep cuts to ambient jungle pitched way, way down. Jackie's photo—swaddled in blankets, bathed in warm lamplight—shows the best way to take this one in. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNosedrip\nLive: Dekmantel Festival 2019\n\nIt's one thing to play a bunch of psychedelic dub and obscure post-punk on the radio. It's something else entirely to mix it at a festival and hold the dance floor. That's what Nosedrip did on the Red Light Radio stage at Dekmantel this summer. Luckily, we now have the recording to pogo to. In the STROOM head's hands, a rare Belgian cut like Siglo XX's \"Individuality\" becomes a statement of purpose: \"I don't wanna be like the others / I am an originality / In search for individuality.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSybil Jason\nBlowing Up The Workshop 103 \n\nSybil Jason's Blowing Up The Workshop mix is only 40 minutes long and it ends abruptly after a particularly satisfying transition. Showcasing her range, this quick, intense and blindsiding mix ranges from weirdo downtempo to synth-pop to techno, as Jason jumps between eras like a skilled time traveler. She had a bigger year than ever in 2019, and it's DJing skills like this that got her there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpekki Webu\nNous'klaer Radio #20\n\nThough trance has been bubbling up again in dance music for a few years now, in 2019 it took centre-stage. While some turned to Eurodance for inspiration, Spekki Webu sought out the throb of the genre's earlier psychedelic forms. This precise set for Nous'klaer Audio is a masterclass in otherworldly DJing, journeying into hallucinogenic, hypnagogic soundscapes before it melts into the ether.","/features/3541",2019,-1,0,0],["","Eris Drew","Eris Drew\nRaving Disco Breaks Vol. 1\n\nOn this year's funkiest mixtape, Eris Drew made some of dance music's most classic sounds her own.

The Chinese-born, Vancouver-based artist's mix references her classical piano training, the death of her mother and her love of Edward Yang films. In Yu Su's singular world, Liszt's impressionistic piano swells blend seamlessly into Terekke's deep dubs and the motorik optimism of Kraftwerk. The mixing and flow are remarkable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNathan Micay\nBIS Radio Show #946\n\nNathan Micay has long professed a love for trance and progressive house anthems, but few of his sets capture it as well as this radio session, which begins with the euphoric swell of Björk's \"Big Time Sensuality,\" weaves through Paul Oakenfold remixing Smashing Pumpkins and Grooverider reworking The Stone Roses, with newer day-glo productions holding things up in between. If you're dying for an alternate future where '90s excess never ended, this mix is for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkua\nDISCWOMAN 51\n\nAkua is one of many young techno artists who aren't afraid to notch up the tempo, and she's also one of the DJs who does it the best. Full of throttling kick drums, careening synths and thrillingly broken rhythms, Akua makes you feel like you're hurtling through the air at Mach 3. It's a fast and skilled mix worthy of the DJ heroes—Claude Young, Mike Dearborn—that she names in the accompanying interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCL\nHNYPOT 291: Ode To The Queer Steppas\n\nOn \"Ode To The Queer Steppas,\" their entry in Honey Soundsystem's excellent podcast series, CCL gives us tour through dubstep's strange outer reaches. Weaving together cuts from innovators like T++, Peverelist, Pinch and Shackleton, as well as newer bits from labels like SUED, the mix is balmy, psychedelic and utterly devoid of genre clichés. HNYPOT 291 exemplified that most difficult of DJ tricks: make a familiar style sound utterly different.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLSDXOXO\nFACT Mix 667\n\nLSDXOXO's journey from enterprising hip-hop producer to edit master to no-holds-barred DJ has been exciting to watch. This mix, jumping from old-school house and techno to Baltimore club to ghettotech to hardstyle and lots of subgenres in between, is no less of a rush. It's classic, it's new, it's queer and it's tough, and it's an example of the kind of flair that should help this New Yorker make waves in his new home of Berlin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvalon Emerson\nEssential Mix\n\nIt's not exactly surprising that Avalon Emerson's Essential Mix is good as it is, but you still have to marvel. The mixing is slick, dynamic and bold. The tracklist is full of private edits and upcoming music by talented friends (Aurora Halal, Nathan Micay, Overmono), as well as curveball bits of shoegaze and synth pop. As for that bit with the Soul II Soul acapella played at the wrong speed over a rumbling Paul Woolford track—was there a better moment in any mix this year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nre:ni\nXLR8R Podcast 557\n\nRecorded live at the debut edition of Orbits festival, you can almost feel the sweltering Portuguese heat emanating from re:ni's opening tracks. Everything is built from the same building blocks—precisely layered percussion, unconventional rhythms and airy pads—as the mix builds up from soft dub and trippy chuggers to psychedelic techno. It's a lesson in coaxing mid-afternoon revelers onto the dance floor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeach\nDISCWOMAN 55\n\n\"I don't think I've been ever very good at the chill thing,\" Peach admitted when her Discwoman mix was published in October. No matter: her sets happily exist in a space well outside the chill zone. DISCWOMAN 55 was as bright as it was tough, with dreamy breakbeats, 135 BPM rave, the odd dollar-bin oldie and loads of great new music. This was Peach doing what she does best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRicardo Villalobos\nEssential Mix\n\nWhat constitutes a good Ricardo set is one of dance music's enduring questions. This one, recorded at Amnesia in Ibiza, has been decried in some quarters for being too commercial. There are some bigger-room tunes in here, not least the Girada Unlimited rework of \"Zapatac,\" but Ricardo's signature tightrope walk between hyper-precision and his famous no-fucks-given attitude is in full effect. And you know from those fader-flicks in the opening stretch that you're in for a treat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmar\nMOJ mixes 15\n\nThough currently based in Berlin, Omar comes from Uruguay, a scene where Nicolas Lutz looms large. No surprise then that he'd deliver such a stellar contribution to the podcast series of My Own Jupiter, a \"multidisciplinary art platform\" run by Lutz and Edurne.  A high-energy trip through charismatic techno, electro and house, Omar's mix moves through a range of sounds and moods, strung together with the slick transitions associated with Uruguay's homegrown selectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMumdance\nShared Meanings\n\nIf you're the type of person who delights in music that sounds like nothing that came before, Mumdance is your guy. Recorded as a free companion to the compilation he curated, this mix flirts with techno and drum & bass and swerves off the genre map altogether. Featuring tracks from Nkisi, Bambounou and Galaxian, Shared Meanings rounds up some of the most defiantly futuristic club tracks of the year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle Hall and Jay Daniel\nLive: Fundamentals @ Marble Bar Detroit\n\nDespite their international acclaim, Kyle Hall and Jay Daniel are doing it for Detroit. Case in point: their Fundamentals party, a no-frills back-to-back session that's gone down over six years at bars, coffee shops and lofts in the D. This live recording from Marble Bar is a masterclass exploring the intersection of Detroit house, the jazzy '90s Chicago sound, UK broken beat and a whole lot of soul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlikback\nUnsound Podcast\n\nSlikback's first gig outside East Africa took place in a Kraków basement on a chilly night at this year's Unsound festival. That performance saw the Kenyan artist play an hour of trap, grime and deconstructed club music—all his own music and remixes, including a tune he'd made earlier that day. It was one of the festival's highlights, announcing the arrival of yet another exciting Nyege Nyege talent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeatrice Dillon\nFACT Mix 657\n\nUnafraid of pauses, jitters or pivots in direction, Beatrice Dillon showcases her distinctive approach to DJing on this winding mix. She describes it as an hour of \"complete tracks and cut up fragments of work by so many different artists,\" with credit given only to artists and no track titles. Carefully arranging tracks like a jigsaw puzzle, it's the way they interlock and sit together that reveals a bigger picture as the mix unfolds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMx. Silkman\nBeyond / Below 10\n\nIn less than a year, Hi-Vis's Beyond / Below mix series has established itself as a go-to for ambient mixes, thanks to an open-ended approach that emphasizes both patience and personality. This mix from Cleveland's Mx. Silkman might be the best of them all. It's peaceful with a hint of tension, and underlined with a kosmische-inspired sense of melody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkee Mask and Zenker Brothers\nUnsound Podcast\n\nUnsound Festival is ostensibly a showcase for music's cutting edge, but it's also earned a reputation for being a superb place to cut loose. Exhibit A: this three-way back-to-back from Skee Mask and Zenker Brothers, recorded early one Sunday morning in Hotel Forum's main room. The range of styles reflects the Ilian Tape sound, but its rowdy energy draws from jungle—from the spinbacks to the volatile, seat-of-your-pants mixing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYaeji\nBlowing Up The Workshop 98\n\nThere are artists who stand out in their field, and there are artists who are their own field—like Yaeji. Not content to merely play 40 minutes of her favorite music, on Blowing Up The Workshop 98 she adds improvised vocals to create a kind of mix/mixtape hybrid. Yaeji hums, whispers, raps and sings over modern club tracks from the likes of Etch, Chevel and the late DJ Rashad, using her voice and effects to make stylistic jumps feel like natural transitions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeki Latex\nThe Naked King\n\nThis guy doesn't call himself the \"king of blends\" for nothing. The third and final instalment in the French artist's mix trilogy might be the most hilarious and impressive of them all. Squarepusher into Lil' Flip? Sure. Crime Mob's \"Knuck If You Buck\" over Swedish House Mafia? Why not. Eurythmics into Daft Punk into DJ Deeon? Naturally. Every moment of this mix is so turbo-charged with energy and humour, it's like a roller coaster ride you'll want to go on again and again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKampire\nSounds Of Sónar\n\nKampire set the tone for her standout set at this year's Sónar festival with this Sounds Of Sónar mix, released a couple of months before the main event in Barcelona. It was some calling card from the Kampala DJ, mixing up fresh sounds from Angola, Uganda, Nigeria and the DRC. Full of catchy pop hooks and booming bass, this one showed precisely why Kampire is one of East Africa's leading DJs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn T. Gast\nUVC Roots & Destruction\n\nJohn T. Gast's enigmatic druid dub creeps quietly out of London with little fanfare, but his fans are cult-like in their devotion to him. This year's instalment of the Roots And Destruction mix series for Bus Editions is more like a solo album than a mixtape, an extension of Gast's private universe that connects dub, knackered electronics and ambient, making heartbreaking paeans with MIDI instruments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMama Snake & Solid Blake\nLive: Dekmantel Festival 2018\n\nApeiron Crew cofounders Mama Snake and Solid Blake are formidable DJs in their own right, but this live recording from Dekmantel shows how phenomenal they are back-to-back. From the brooding electro to the Shepard tones of Ploy's \"Garys,\" through wild cuts of breakbeat, electro, techno and trance, the duo's 90-minute set at Dekmantel's UFO stage is a reminder of the kind of synergy that a back-to-back makes possible. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolet\nCrack Mix 214\n\nAs founder of the record label Naive, cofounder of Rádio Quântica and a string of local parties, Inês Coutinho is a galvanizing force in Lisbon's music scene. She's also a sick DJ, as small clubs and parties around the world are beginning to discover, and as her Crack mix makes clear. Elegantly swerving through one raucous banger after another, never playing the saying type of track twice, Crack 214 shows a gifted DJ having a blast with her records. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupsammy\nBAR Radio #40\n\nWhen she's not making bangers, Thessa Torsing, AKA upsammy, spends most of her time digging for bleepy curios. She's got a particular penchant for downtempo tracks in the 90 BPM range, a style she explores beautifully on BAR Radio #40. The mix is a slo-mo meander through golden ambient, IDM and other hard-to-define melodic jams. There's even a UK bass track played at the wrong speed. Together, they form one of the year's classiest and most adventurous mixes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nobject blue\nBandcloud Guest Mix\n\nThe Beijing-born, London-based artist object blue was a producer and live act before she was a DJ, and the way she mixes tracks has the arresting flair of a live performance. Her Bandcloud mix is a good example. Dizzyingly complex but intuitive, blending techno, breaks, experimental club and footwork, she bobs and weaves through angular, futuristic sounds with an ease that reflects her level of technique. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlo Dill\nSANPO 121\n\nThe aesthetic of Australia's Sanpo Disco mix series is leisurely—\"Sanpo\" is Japanese for \"stroll,\" the series being inspired by its founder's love of long walks. NTS regular Flo Dill got the memo, starting out with some glorious Pat Metheny on ECM, before spending an hour sharing the wistful music that soundtracks her bus commutes around London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDJ Healer\nPlanet Lonely\n\nIn May, a few weeks after his his double-album release on Easter Sunday, DJ Healer released a free mix through his Soundcloud page called Planet Lonely. Except it isn't really a mix. Moments of silence separate its dozens of tracks, which dip through ambient, downtempo and something like drum & bass, their mellowness offset by themes of self-destruction and apocalypse anxiety. Released as an album, Planet Lonely would have been among the year's biggest records. And yet this oddly understated format seems fitting, if only within the strange logic of this artist's word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDJ Senior Vasquez\nPARAISOMIX001\n\nYou probably know about the Detroit-Berlin connection, but how about the New York-Lisbon connection? New York master Junior Vasquez was a fan of the Portuguese tribal sound of the mid-'90s, and he often played tracks by Portuguese producers at the Sound Factory in Manhattan. DJs like Danny Tenaglia caught on too, and a musical bond formed between the two scenes. Lisbon's Photonz makes this sonic connection audible with this funky, smooth mix of Portuguese house from that era. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNazira\nMixmag - Kazakhstan scene\n\nThe proverbial electronic music map has expanded these last few years, with cities like Kiev, Tbilisi and Montevideo earning overdue recognition. Nazira's January mix for Mixmag turned our attention to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, and her hometown. Capturing the sound of Nazira's ZVUK parties, its big basslines, razor-sharp synths and precision rhythms offer a thrilling glimpse into this small but lively scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvan Baggs\nXLR8R Podcast 530\n\nIn the two years between Evan Baggs' RA Podcast and this mix for XLR8R, his focus on an acidic strain of vintage sci-fi techno has tightened. Baggs embodies excellence in this field, and the mix is a sort of mission statement for the vision he's built over the past three or four years alongside artists like Binh and DJ Masda. Without feeling remotely nostalgic, it's a history of dance music's forgotten corners that jolts the present with new energy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlive T\nTruancy Volume 205\n\nOn first glance, Olive T's Truancy mix feels like it's going to be a smooth ride through deep and melodic house. Then it starts to get more psychedelic, ratcheting up to a rude and heavy breakbeat section before settling back down again.
