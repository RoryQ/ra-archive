        "description": "Emotional Machine Funk2025 has been defined by the collapse of techno optimism. Where the nascent internet's frontier spirit once pointed to a bright future, today that promise feels sinister, curdled by the \"corporate gloom\" and data extraction documented in Liz Pelly's excellent book, Mood Machine. The year's most compelling machine funk reflects this irradiated state of distress on a personal and collective level, as well as caution about what our technological destiny truly holds.The electro, techno and slanted IDM we listened to in 2025 went beyond techno pessimism to focus on other knotty concepts, such as grief and loss, provoking visceral gut punches to attain those physical highs. It's music that makes you feel and move, which, if you go back to Detroit techno's history, has always been there. No one told this story better than the Motor City's early pioneers, whose fragile and furious proto-techno output was never blindly optimistic. RA's staff picks of the year pull from this DNA: DJ Bone's The End Of Never, with its muscular electro, stands as the embodiment of Detroit, rooted in a '90s urban reality that focused on interrogating systems of power and decay.These ghosts of past motifs echo through these releases, which are neither hopeful nor nostalgic throwbacks. This is machine music deeply rooted in the turmoil of the present, asserting that the sound of the zeitgeist refuses to be background noise. It's a defiant new link in a chain of creation that speaks to adversity, and it demands that we listen. What does that say about 2025, that artists are trying to produce music that says something through bleeps and bloops again?– Chloe LulaRecord of the YearBlawanSickElixirAfter more than a decade at the forefront of club music, Blawan could easily have settled into legacy act territory, churning out formulaic imitations of past successes from the comfort of the techno assembly line. Instead, on SickElixir, he doubles down on innovation.The album finds the UK artist at his most vulnerable. Themes of grief, trauma and addiction (he recently spoke to Crack about having to leave Berlin after drugs \"basically shattered\" his life there) are folded into serrated rhythms and monstrous, almost bodily vocal work—even fleeting moments of warmth arrive refracted through a darker lens. The ferocity of his early work remains, yet the melodic smears, fragmented vocal gasps and unexpectedly tender swells reflect an artist intent on expanding his emotional bandwidth. SickElixir sees Blawan turn years of experience into something raw and profound.– Michael LawsonRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordsMarie DavidsonCity Of ClownsIn a world shackled by surveillance capitalism, Marie Davidson posits what might be the only true subversion left: satirising this power structure with sexual hedonism run rampant. City Of Clowns brings this madcap concept to life. Thunderous, funky basslines and mind-melting electro synths are helmed by Davidson, who plays the Alexa-like narrator gone rogue, extolling the virtues of data mining with expletives and double entendres. If the machinist future our tech overlords are envisioning is even one tenth as sexy as this, bring on the singularity.– Jake IndianaRead the full reviewListen:BandcampUnspecified EnemiesRomance in the Age of Adaptive FeedbackPart of the enduring magic of '90s Detroit-school techno is how the producers made pieces of hardware sing. Louis Digital isn't from Detroit and it isn't the mid-90s, but you can't tell by listening to Romance in the Age of Adaptive Feedback. Equal parts nostalgic and futuristic, brimming with feeling and assembly-line grooves, the record is a pitch-perfect homage to classic Motor City techno and electro by a true lover of the form.– Henry IvryRead the full reviewListen:BandcampTracksDJ Bone\"Deep Inside\"On \"Deep Inside,\" DJ Bone pairs his famously surgical drumwork with a simple vocal mantra, a reminder that there's a human pulse driving the circuitry. As the oscillating synths kick in, elastic and almost overcooked, the track feels like a machine learning its purpose, pushed by a human hand that refuses to let the gears lock into place. The way he flares open the mix turns his tight grid into something that emulates a living, breathing organism.– Reid BGRead the full reviewListen:BandcampSandwell District\"Hidden\"Austere techno brutalism be damned—on End Beginnings highlight, \"Hidden,\" Regis and Function returned to their Sandwell District project with a rounded melodic sound that found its pocket and leaned deep into it. The track's interplay between insistent acid, throbbing mono synth bass and syncopated sub rumble displays a funkiness more readily associated with Motor City titans. \"Hidden\" evokes the shadowy, emotive pulse of Carl Craig classic \"Sandstorms\" while giving it the Sandwell District pressure-cooker treatment.– Oli WarwickRead the full reviewListen:BandcampMixLimited NetworkITPS119 LIMITED NETWORKAs Limited Network, Detroit-based artist Max Watts channels the city's lineage, using the TB-303 to connect classic machine funk with its sleek 2020s mutation. His Ilian Tape mix opens with tight 303 sequences: clean resonance peaks, controlled envelopes and a filter sweep that traces a line from forebears like Robert Hood and Jeff Mills. Rather than treat acid as nostalgia, the mix unfolds with curiosity, moving through Drexciya-esque passages and punchy electro workouts. Watts honours Detroit's foundations while showing how the machine-funk blueprint still resonates today.– Bella AquilinaListen:SoundCloudFurther ListeningPolygonia, Wata IgarashiCross PassageListen:BandcampBlack SitesR4Listen:BandcampEhua\"Aria\"Listen:BandcampBarker\"Stochastic Drift\"Read the reviewListen:BandcampTraxxThe Definitive Articles of House Music Chapter 6Listen:SoundCloudListen to the Emotional Machine Funk playlistSpotify",

        "description": "Bass WeightWe should've clocked it when FWD>> and Tempa returned. From late 2024 through 2025, bass weight has been pushed into new places. From Bristol outlet Dimeshift, which continues to lead fresh, first wave-inspired dubstep, to Beatrice M., who released a strong run of their own tunes, as well as issuing music from the likes of Tighe, Old Man Crane and Dangermami via their label, Bait.Across the board, artists increasingly unified the roots of sound system music with their own astute, modern twists, propelled by a more femme-led, internationally reaching school of artists and labels. Introspekt's Moving the Center unlocked a newfound sensuality in dubstep and dark garage; tracks like Mia Koden's \"Skank Steady\" bottled anticipation for summer with floating keys and a warm bassline; Lauren Duffus's excellent Can's Gone Warm EP served weighty alt-pop, folding in trip-hop and post-dubstep shimmer reminiscent of Kelela's Cut 4 Me. And then Tracey & Riko Dan's \"Sex Life\" abandoned elegance entirely, taking a thrumming low-end and plonking a pithy hook on top: \"All I wanna do is fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.\"Alongside Beatrice M., names like EMA were busy earning much-deserved flowers with standout festival sets, while legends assembled in the form of Mala and dub techno veteran Paul St. Hilaire, who collaborated on \"Like It's Always Been,\" the opening track on St. Hilaire's album. In a year that Timedance and SPE:C turned ten (and Tectonic hit 20), techno-infused bass weight stocks are arguably at an all-time high, and sound system music at large is, in all senses of the word, booming.– Nathan EvansRecord of the YearPaul St. Hilairew/ the ProducersFor Kynant Records' Richard Akingbehin and the voice of dub techno, Paul St. Hilaire, the decision to summon the ghost of Rhythm & Sound's seminal 2003 album, w/ the Artists, was classy yet bold. Would w/ the Producers build on its source material? Or risk living in its shadow? The album's faultless cast of collaborators, including Batu, Shinichi Atobe and Azu Tiwaline, made failure impossible. As a sonic aesthetic, dubwise is flourishing right now, and this LP bottles its power and beauty in myriad tones and tempos, from Mala's orchestral skank on \"Like It's Always Been\" to the slo-mo psych thump of Aurora Halal & DJ G's \"Mary Jane Greenfield.\" The pièce de résistance is, of course, St. Hilaire himself. He graces every beat with poise and purpose, never overdoing it. As the years roll by, once-mythic musicians can lose touch with their former brilliance. Not this Dominican dub poet.– Carlos HawthornRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordsIntrospektMoving The CenterIntrospekt has what you want and what you need. Sound familiar? You might recognise those words from KMA Productions' '96 garage track \"Cape Fear,\" which Introspekt samples on \"Subliminate,\" the final track on her debut album. From the New York-based artist, what we want is something new, fresh and stimulating in a way we've not experienced before. And what we need is dubstep. Introspekt delivers both, making bass-heavy 140 riddims sound smoother and sexier than ever.– Sam DaviesRead the full reviewListen:Bandcampex_libris001 & 002Every time Dave Huismans returns, it's cause for celebration. Just one catch: the lexicon of writers and fans alike falls short in capturing his aversion to fixed form. What exactly is ex_libris? Iridescent, deep electronics, backed by a swirl of percussion and an exceptional attention to textural detail? Rolls right off the tongue. At any rate, this headphone-friendly double drop sums the qualities of his best-known projects—2562's swampy low-end, A Made Up Sound's nonlinear jams—in a teeming soundscape with an almost hydraulic sense of progression. \"It has a lot of character,\" he once told us about his gear, \"and that's why I like it.\" Dave, the feeling's mutual.– Gabriel SzatanListen:BandcampTracksTracey\"Sex Life\"The anonymous London-based duo knocked everyone out of the park with their self-titled debut. Press play once and you'll be convinced. \"Sex Life\" is deadly dubstep in classic form, with a searing verse from vaunted MC Riko Dan. But then, there's a twist. \"Sex Life\" also features surprising interludes of twinkling synths and bubblegum vocal loops with a bedroom pop feel—inflections that add a touch of irreverent internet humour. It's a perfect marriage of neon pop and bass weight—a uniquely 2025 take on dubstep.– Nyshka ChandranListen:BandcampLauren Duffus\"N.U.M.T.E.\"Lauren Duffus's Can's Gone Warm EP is her best work yet. On \"N.U.M.T.E,\" fragile, R&B-inflected vocals float over jittery breakbeats and shadowy synths, recalling the likes of Murlo and MssingNo without ever feeling derivative. The track inhabits the liminal space between the club and the lonely hours after closing, leaving a lingering sense of longing wrapped in mystery. It's exactly the kind of idiosyncratic, emotionally vivid production that marked Duffus as one of the year's most compelling artists.– Fahad AkinsanyaListen:BandcampMixBeatrice M.THE DUBSTEP - TECH HOUSE CONNECTIONIn this NTS Radio entry, Beatrice M. explores the connection between two once maligned genres, dubstep and tech house. Joined by Appleblim, they map the sonic bridge from Bristol to Berlin, zeroing in on the collision point where technoid bass hybrids meet skippy 120-BPM rollers—the juncture where Villalobos can bring low-end into his sets or Shackleton can put steppers onto Perlon.

        "description": "Neo Electronic PopFrom Ray of Light to BRAT, pop records have long repurposed club culture to delight the masses. But in 2025, a sort of reverse osmosis emerged: cutting-edge producers found new avenues for experimentation in pop's effervescent packaging. From Shanti Celeste's glossy love songs on Romance to Oli XL's K-pop meets IDM on Lick The Lens, there's a clear uptick in the use of radio-ready melodies. In a moment when big-room dance music is more mainstream (and more mind-numbing) than ever, underground artists returned to pop as a point of subversion; a new way to enliven drum & bass, trance and trip-hop without sullying the source material.The relationship between pop and dance music dates back to the '80s, when artists like Boy George and The Human League first conceived of pop as a self-aware art form, not a chart metric. Their vision was fuelled by the same anti-establishment spirit that influenced club innovators like Larry Heard and Underground Resistance. In 2025, pop sounds more in line with that original art punk mentality than it has in decades. There's always been pop worth dancing to, but it's been a long time since so many skilled dance music producers have contributed to the cause.– Hattie LindertRecord of the YearOklouchoke enoughThe off‑centre vaporwave pop songs on Oklou's radical debut make for perfect bedroom music. The French musician's hypnagogic dream logic and tender harmonies render life's most existential moments with microscopic precision and a lulling calm. \"endless\" opens like a beacon from a far‑off village, her dulcet, auto‑tuned vocals shutting out all notifications from the outside world. \"thank you for recording\" turns surveillance into a lullaby, while \"blade bird\" crystallises the album's themes of attachment and harm into weightless nursery rhymes. In the background hum of 2025's global crises, this kind of dissociative dream pop feels spot on, turning panic into an exquisitely arranged experience. This is a record for soft clubbing; for dreamers who want the night to blur rather than explode.– Gio SantiagoRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordskeiyaAhooke's lawIt's rare to be transported inside an artist's head. keiyaA's second album is so expressive that listeners can almost hear her neurons crackling as she crafts track after track of achingly intimate music. It's like reading her diary, while also pilfering her drug stash. The Chicago-raised artist translates the chaos of heartbreak, self-doubt, rage and mental illness into a brilliant bricolage of experimental pop and R&B. These 19 cuts are surreal and unsettling, but also raw and truthful, portraying soul music as both escapism and catharsis.– Cameron CookRead the full reviewListen:BandcampPinkPantheressFancy ThatPinkPantheress crashed into 2025 with a mixtape that supercharged the London producer's breakbeat-driven sound. Her recognisable traits—a core palette of UKG, jungle, drum & bass; Y2K-era samples, conversational vocals—remain, but overall, Fancy That is so bold and bright that it feels like a reinvention. Hands-in-the-air moments, faster tempos and peak-time melodies are abundant. With surprise summer hits like the Underworld-sampling \"Illegal\" and the Groove Armada-inspired \"Stateside,\" the young luminary proved she can go from being an internet star to the leader of club-pop's next generation.– Shaad D'SouzaRead the full reviewListen:SpotifyTracksFKA twigs\"Girl Feels Good\"Eusexua is all about revelation—the sensation of finding your true self \"under a hard metal silver stiletto on the damp rave floor.\" On \"Girl Feels Good,\" the album's trip-hop highlight, the UK multi-hyphenate celebrates this sentiment with unbridled joy. Over brooding guitar and an entrancing techno-pop chorus, she sings how a woman's blossoming pleasure can fill a night with infinite potential. A proper ode to female desire, this is a song as sacred as it is profane.– Vrinda JagotaRead the full reviewListen:SpotifyRochelle Jordan\"Bite The Bait\"Rochelle Jordan's sixth album, Through The Wall, served a masterclass in assured and sexy house with a pop sheen. \"Bite The Bait,\" produced by regular collaborator Jimmy Edgar, is a late-night R&B jam where the Chicago artist's teasing, honeyed soprano drips over stripped-back drums.\"Pulled up to the party it was me, myself and I / Breaking hella hearts I didn't even have to try,\" she sings, radiating a quiet confidence that carries the track right from the club to the afters at dawn.– Katie ThomasListen:BandcampMixbambinodjLIVE FROM EARTH Mix 79If you've fallen for the hazy alt-pop of Oklou or Malibu, you'll find a kindred spirit in bambinodj. His music welds the Black diasporic sounds of shatta, amapiano and Flex Dance Music with trance, ambient and IDM. These aren't genres that a DJ would typically pair, but in bambinodj's world, it makes perfect sense. This mix encapsulates his sonic DNA: downtempo Balearic haze, inscrutable SoundCloud oddities, Caribbean rhythms and majestic piano leads that put Marc Cohn's Walking in Memphis to shame.– Fahad AkinsanyaListen:SoundCloudFurther ListeningSudan ArchivesThe BPMListen:BandcampJim Legxacyblack british music (2025)Listen:BandcampFcukers\"Play Me\"Listen:BandcampGeorge Riley\"Private Life\"Listen:SpotifyMalibuUnited In Flames w/ JAMESJAMESJAMESListen:SoundCloudListen to the Neo Electronic Pop playlistSpotify",

        "description": "Noise DistortionDance music's edges have frayed in fascinating ways in 2025. Whether an attempt to make sense of a world still vibrating with instability, or simply a rejection of the overpolished club tools that continue to flood the scene, some of the year's best releases have been forged from the cracks—records that find beauty in disintegration.At the centre of this shift is a renewed fascination with noise and distortion, not only as sonic aesthetic but as emotional language. Disparate artists seem to be drawn to sounds that carry strain, abrasion or a sense of dislocation. Distortion communicates pressure—be that in a personal sense or wider communities navigating upheaval. Even when artists such as Los Thuthanaka or aya pushed their palettes into raw or blown-out territory, it was less about harshness for its own sake and more about revealing what lay beneath the polish.Equally, distortion took on a more introspective bent. Producers working in slower or more reflective modes—Klein, DJ Haram, Rainy Miller—leaned into erosion as a kind of emotional texture. Their use of noise suggested memory slipping, feelings blurring, structures softening rather than breaking.While far from a new phenomenon, perhaps this turn toward noise is a response to an era defined by overstimulation. Amid algorithmic smoothness and endless playlists, distortion feels like something human again. It restores the club's physicality: a reminder that dance music has always thrived on what doesn't quite fit, on frequencies that shake your body as much as they move your feet.– Michael LawsonRecord of the YearLos ThuthanakaLos ThuthanakaUnless you experience synesthesia, listening to Los Thuthanaka might be the closest you'll get to seeing sound. Digitised Andean folk music brings to mind brown mountains and deep blue lakes, while corroded synths are redlined to evoke a radioactive lime green. The first collaborative album from siblings Joshua Crampton and Chuquimamani-Condori melds Andean folk, queer psychedelia and staticky ambient into an ultra-digital experience. Crampton's chugging electric guitar provides the bedrock, setting the atmosphere ablaze while Chuquimamani-Condori gets busy with their sampler, adding bursts of humour via cartoonish, pitched-down voices yelling \"Yo!\" or \"Grrrrr!\" over sun-dappled rhythms. These crackling loops become heaving, transcendental waves of sound, haptic feedback sent all the way down from their ancestors.– Kiana MicklesRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordsayahexed!Trauma scuffs your spirit, the way an explosion leaves your ears ringing. aya's mesmerising second album seeks to confront her past battles with substance addiction head-on and out loud. The album is rife with one detonation after another, conveying the dark side of the never-ending afters. Muddy digital roar becomes purifying fire; the feedback of a siren's call pulls you in like a friend begging you to party. But listen through to the end of the record, and you'll hear the victorious sound of newfound self-control.– Jesse DorrisRead the full reviewListen:BandcampDJ KRadio Libertadora !On his debut LP, PANICO NO SUBMUNDO, São Paulo producer DJ K made as much noise as possible, defying conservative efforts to silence Brazilian funk with walls of tuin-tinged sub-bass unique to bruxaria, his preferred strain.

He raps about the daughter of a doctor who chooses to be a marginal (thug) on \"SOBREVIVE CONTRA O ESTADO,\" his words ringing loud and clear above the fanfare.

It feels as if the previous 37 minutes sublimate into air: the track's final howl reduced to a breeze blowing through wind chimes, a fragile calm earned through terrifying catharsis.

        "description": "Guitar JamsRight now, guitars are everywhere in electronic music, a reflection of the great blending of genres that's defined the past five years. In 2025, albums were rarely anchored to one sound, often enlisting the malleable quality of the guitar to transform electronic beats into rock ballads. As one of the oldest instruments, guitars can provoke a jolt of time-worn emotion. That tug on the heart when you hear a lonely minor key? Practically baked into human DNA. Ambling post-rock arpeggios can inspire visions of pastoral terrain, while an indie-pop glissando might give you a new lease of life. Fans clamour to see Smerz's dramatic live rendition of \"You got time and I got money,\" while at home they hit replay for the moping chords that stretch out below the duo's honeyed lyrics.Rock faded out of the mainstream in the late '00s, as EDM, rap and pop surged across the next decade. The genre struggled to reclaim its place in the zeitgeist, until a post-pandemic malaise stalked the music industry and everyone reached for their guitars. Copenhagen—which, in addition to Smerz, is home to Astrid Sonne, ML Buch and Erika de Casier—led the charge. Using the guitar as a textural tool, these artists built layers atop introspective electronic foundations. They bottled a year of political turmoil and economic decline into songs that felt double-sided, capturing a youthful angst alongside a yearning for something, anything, more.– Kiana MicklesRecord of the Yearjames KFriendOn Friend, Jamie Krasner wields her guitar with the freedom of an acrobat flying through the air. Using space to transformative effect, she defies expectations of electronic pop songwriting through her mastery of genre. Wispy tones lap gently against glowing reverbed vocals, bringing an expansive feel to the album's unique strain of ethereality.There's no doubt Krasner can shred in a more classic indie rock vein (see \"On God\"'s swathes of dream pop chords), but where she really excels is in transforming the guitar altogether through sampling and meticulously applied FX. Whether it's chugging alongside the peppy heartbeat drums on \"Play,\" sputtering over choral vocal samples on the cavernous \"Rider\" or undulating at the core of trip-hoppy \"Blinkmoth (July Mix),\" her guitar shapeshifts throughout Friend's electronic landscape as mutably as a synth could.– Sue ParkRead the full reviewListen:BandcampRecordsAcopiaBlush ResponseAcopia's third album is a shimmering haze of shoegaze guitars and soft, yearning vocals. Moving away from the drum programming and grittier, bass-driven sound of previous records, Blush Response revels in downtempo, sparse grooves and cool-headed trip-hop. Vocalist Kate Durman channels her lilting soubrette over distorted fuzz, reverb-laden guitar tones and the wonky harmonics of tracks like \"Chase Me\" and \"Let Down.\" The album is a dreamlike, wafting soundworld seen through bleary eyes.– Ammar KaliaRead the full reviewListen:BandcampJoanne RobertsonBlurrrIn a year full of albums that sound like they might have drifted from an abandoned campsite, Blurrr distinguishes itself with the subtle spectrum of sound it teases from everyday tools. The UK musician's guitar groans in her hands as much as it sings, always a low, solid counterweight to her floating and translucent voice. This is an album that envelopes you like mist: slowly, imperceptibly, until all of a sudden it's all you can see.– Sasha GeffenRead the full reviewListen:BandcampTracksSmerz\"You got time and I got money\"On \"You got time and I've got money,\" Smerz cement their claim to Scandi fame. It's the Copenhagen duo's own \"Bittersweet Symphony,\" an orchestral love song that documents the thrill of a new relationship. Although the track's smoky bass guitar plucks a refrain in D minor sharp—the key of mourning—it still lands as a serene dispatch from the honeymoon phase, all warm embraces and waking up together. Over the smoothest drumline of the year, Catharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt wallow in a grounded romance: patient, consistent and built to endure.– Hattie LindertListen:BandcampNourished By Time\"Max Potential\"The brazen heart of \"Max Potential\" is riven: between passion and resignation, romance and staying true to oneself. This standout from Nourished By Time's fantastic second album, The Passionate Ones, establishes a remarkable sweep. The Baltimore singer teases out love's inherent freneticism, while the arrangements shift wildly—a frantic dynamic for frantic times. Eventually, the protean musical sensibility whips the urgent central lyric, \"If I'm gonna go insane / At least I'm loved by you,\" into a mantra for the steadfast and enamoured. The effect is irresistible.– Daniel FelsenthalRead the full reviewListen:BandcampMixLogic1000DJ​-​Kicks: Logic1000Conceived as a \"little piece of serenity,\" Logic1000's dreamy, zoned-out mix for !K7's iconic DJ-Kicks series wrapped us in a cocoon, capturing the mood for all things downtempo across a vapour trail of ambient dub, of-the-moment trip-hop and esoteric Scandi pop.

        "description": "Club HeatersAt the end of every year, we usually identify a single track that seemed to unite every club and festival stage. Think Maya Jane Coles' \"What They Say,\" Kassem Mosse's \"Untitled (A1)\" or Joy Orbison's 2024 smash \"flight fm,\" tracks that sliced clean through our imagined trenches and could make any dance floor move in unison.In 2025, it felt like that moment never quite materialised. Don't get us wrong: the absence of a unanimous dance floor heater doesn't mean there wasn't a slew of excellent club music coming out. It's more that the heat got more localised. It's long been true that what goes off in, say, New York, stands apart from what works in Ibiza, and this year, those differences made the notion of a single, standout club anthem untenable.The lack of universal hits, however, meant more breathing room. This year, the producers soundtracking peak-time moments have stayed small, specific and rooted. For the cohort revelling against AI slop, algorithmic sameness and other homogenising forces, the result was a landscape defined by artistic pluralism and local autonomy rather than one-size-fits-all trends.This shift hints at progress. The appetite for hard and fast persists, sure, but it mutated, shaped by space, crowd and context. Instead of one monolithic sound dominating the scene, you get micro-moments: whether that be the Come Round EP by DJ PGZ & Yikes, two Aboriginal producers staking their claim on the sound of Australian dance floors and bush doofs; or Kiara Scuro and Sugar Free, whose respective releases channelled a sleazy, slow-burning chug familiar to anyone who has clocked in hours at fabric or Houghton. A welcome reminder that the notion of peak time can—and should—offer something different for every floor.– Bella AquilinaRecord of the YearDJ PGZ & YikesCome RoundCome Round has the unbridled energy of a peak-time dance floor coursing through it. Gunai/Kurnai and Yorta Yorta artist DJ PGZ and Boorloo-based Wongi artist Yikes forged their bond in underground spaces—from DJ PGZ attending formative queer parties to inviting Yikes to play his first set at Sub Club in Naarm. Here, that early spark comes full circle. Across solo cuts, cross-remixes and a standout joint track, \"Ouss Ouss,\" the release maps two artists searching for, and ultimately locking into, unity in their respective sounds.It's full throttle from the get‑go: all big, wubby basslines, fierce vocal chops and swirling crescendos that summon the kind of feral inhibition only a grimy basement can unlock. DJ PGZ's pulsing hard techno interlocks with Yikes's spacious, trance-leaning grooves, all threaded by percussive broken beats. The result captures a powerful moment, as two First Nations producers propel Australian dance music into its next chapter.– Hannah DoodyListen:BandcampRecordsKiara ScuroNight Crush​​On Kassian's Rinse FM show in February, Rosie Ama described Night Crush, the debut (and final) Kiara Scuro EP, as \"an ode to being on the dance floor when you don't really know what time it is.\" That disoriented thrill runs through all three tracks: the haziness of heavy reverb and the way the deep, rolling grooves lock your body into the rhythm. Every so often, a repeating riff on opener \"Witching Hour\" invites that movement, murmuring \"body, in motion.\" File this one with your favourite Planet Euphorique releases.– Katie ThomasListen:BandcampSugar FreeDisociandoJust like her DJ sets, Sugar Free's debut EP squirms with amoebic movement. Disociando's prog house and tech house cuts swell and contract like jellyfish in water, balancing moments of hips-swaying bliss with heads-down enthralment. Pared-back drums add tension and a touch of sleaze, while gorgeous textural details—oddball synth burbles and feedback buildups—bring a zany experimentalism into the mix. This striking amalgam of psychedelia, minimal house and bounce is a peak-time treat with grit and groove, but it's also slinky enough to work the afters.– Nyshka ChandranRead the full reviewListen:BandcampTracksWOST\"Banda\"Not \"banda\" as in band, but as in crew. This Spanish translation nails the mantra of the global posse that WOST and Colombian label TraTraTrax have been rallying over the years. On \"Banda,\" the Bogotá-based producer unleashes a percussive cut that's travelled from Video Club to Rinse FM. There's FM synthesis, a drum breakdown and a sped-up dembow tresillo beat so syncopated it sounds like it might mutate into dubstep with each bar. As the gap between the Latin American and UK undergrounds keeps closing, \"Banda\" proves electronic fusion never has to dilute flavour.– Rachel Grace AlmeidaListen:BandcampJump Source\"On (feat. Martyn Bootyspoon)\"Patrick Holland and Priori have been quietly producing with other artists—like james K and Physical Therapy—from their Montreal studio. They've still had time to crank out earworms like \"On,\" a euphoric club track so infectious it disarms even the most dedicated techno purists. The confluence of Jump Source's meticulous production and Martyn Bootyspoon's signature vocal swagger is a showcase in style that feels both retro-futurist and viscerally current. In a sense, it's the sound of 2025—a reach for nostalgic sounds that sits undeniably in the present.– Chloe LulaListen:BandcampMixDJ Tobzy Imole GiwaLagos City UnloadedThe algorithm demands bitesized clips of DJs blending belters together. You can either curse this tyranny, or do like DJ Tobzy Imole Giwa does and exaggerate the formula. On Lagos City Unloaded, the cruise beat DJ blitzes through hyperspeed pop, R&B and Eurodance alongside continental genres like Afrobeat, kwaito and amapiano. During one flurry, Lil Wayne's famous \"A Milli\" a capella creeps in with the subtlety of Looney Tunes's Sylvester before being ousted by the Tweety Bird-pitched trill of Yves Larock's \"Rise Up.\" As DJ Tobzy pushes everything he touches to cartoonish extremes, he makes disparate genres find copious common ground.– Joseph FrancisListen:BandcampFurther ListeningBaaltiMelaRead the reviewListen:BandcampPloyIt's Later Than You ThinkRead the reviewListen:BandcampKhadija Al Hanafi\"Bounce It On The Flo\"Listen:BandcampJSPORT\"No Turning Back\"Listen:BandcampKontronatura b2b Nick LeónCarnaval Novo AffairListen:SoundCloudListen to the Club Heaters playlistSpotify",

        "description": "Halfway through Nono Gigsta's sequel to her 2018 Freerotation set, also named The House of Crocodiles, we get an indication of the strange title's origins. \"The males' rippling flesh sends soundwaves through the water… humans can barely hear them, but the crocodiles can. Welcome to the House of Crocodiles,\" a sample narrates. And then, oh so naturally, it moves into a roaring electric guitar solo (Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lotta Love\"). It's a bonkers move that can prompt you to completely rethink what DJing can be. It's also completely natural in the hands of the Belgian DJ.Jaw-dropping transitions dominate this two-hour recording, aptly described as \"Big Blend Academy\" by one commenter. Low-end frequencies anchor the mix as it darts through wild variations in mood and tempo. Dubwise experiments (LUXE's \"Diamond Dub\") morph into frenetic jazz techno (Gigi FM's \"Gabriella\"), sounding like DJ Sprinkles if she dabbled in UK bass. You can feel Gigsta's sense of freedom as she aqueously glides across loose and liquid rhythms.Freewheeling mixes of this sort often risk being overly headsy, but this is a very fun listen that spans Björk, Foster Sylvers and Victoria Monet. The inclusion of more \"popular music\" only adds to the overwhelming sense of feverish delight. There's only one reasonable response to a mix this audacious: \"WTF.\" - Bella Aquilina",

Darting through apocalyptic perreo, guaracha and what some call Latincore, this session is a soundtrack for all your freaky pre-club rituals. When Genosidra slips into a speed dembow refix of JME's \"If You Don't Know\"? Proof that perfection does exist. - Rachel Grace Almeida",

Originating in the Philippines in the early '00s, the street-pioneered sound combines trancey techno and house with fat bass, high-pitched synths and lots of air horns.Now, pioneer DJ Love is showing off a new mutation of the classic sound with \"Bomb Tech 49.\" Fittingly called bomb-tek, this offshoot is more techno-driven and undeniably harder, darker and leaner. Whereas the traditional stylings tend to be chirpier and whimsical, blippy effects, this strain, full of springy basslines and looped drums, takes budots off the streets and into the club. - Nyshka Chandran",

He's had big drops before, but nothing as gargantuan as the lift-off a minute into \"Juggernaut.\" This is \"Tron\" for a whole new generation. - Henry Ivry",

It's the kind of song that seems forgettable at first listen and totally indispensable by your third, in part because it's so confident. Unlike so much pop this year, \"Nasty\" is so unbothered about proving itself to you that it's easy to dismiss at first glance, even as its rubbery bassline and off-kilter vocal samples build and build.

Sandwiched between a pair of heavier bangers, its comparatively low-key B-side, \"Fawn,\" is a masterful distillation of her signature technoid dubstep. Moving at a subtly brisker clip than traditional 140, the track's bass pulses, spiralling vocals and dubbed-out drums shift and cycle, evoking the earth-rattling march of a giant.After 80 seconds of moody table-setting, a playful series of plucks erupts seemingly from nowhere, skipping up and down in pitch. Then, as quickly as it arrived, this cute riff is gone, displaying Carré's deft control over arrangement.

Once you finally manage to decode lyrics, they only heighten the hazy ambience, as he anguishedly calls out: \"I can't win / And I won't end.\" The agent of his heartbreak is unclear; although if the song title offers any hints, it might even be Mk.gee himself. \"Breakthespell\" may not provide clarity, but it doesn't matter—this is the sound of catharsis. - Bella Aquilina",

Occasionally, the transcendental melody is interrupted by a slight key change or the growing swell of indecipherable voices, but it's never enough to unseat the song's steady, meditative pace. \"slob air\" is like watching the sun rise on the top deck of the bus after a bleary night out—life-affirming. - Steph Philips",

The words, profoundly poignant on their own, transform simple ongoings of daily life into acts of resistance during wartime.Paired with strong drums, the track opens with an eerie beat reminiscent of a church bell or a loud clock tolling the arrival of doomsday. The combination of Sabra's gradually distorting voice, the increasingly aggressive rhythm and almost mundane lyrics is deeply hypnotic, immersing us in Snakeskin's alternate reality.

As she sings about the endless transference of love, a trip-hop beat glides and gallops, tactfully situating us in the '90s. But really, it's the heavenly vocals that we're here for. Her delivery glistens with the Elizabeth Fraser effect: carried foremost by feeling, the curvature of her indecipherable lyrics capture the fleeting moment in which euphoria sinks into quiet melancholy.

        "label": "TraTraTrax",
        "description": "A great pop song is like a charm: compact and entrancing, a daydream corked and uncorked at will. If it can't guarantee good fortune, it can at least transport a listener somewhere they feel lucky to be. And no song in 2024 made as great an escape as Nick León and Erika de Casier's \"Bikini.\"\"It leaks into the music somehow,\" León said earlier this month of growing up by the ocean. The Miami native describes his compositions as spaces to inhabit rather than stories; a personal stamp strong enough to transform any output he lends his hand to, be that ambient (Gloria) or perreo heaters (Rompediskoteka). De Casier wields similar scene-setting skills: she wrote one of 2023's stickiest earworms, New Jeans' \"Super Shy,\" without ever sacrificing her signature delicate style presented to perfection on 2019 breakout album, Essentials.An anthem like \"Bikini\" was always on the cards for the pair: their last collaboration, the Dionysian \"Ex-Girlfriend\" with SHYGIRL, nailed the body-first composition of Nelly Furtado and Timbaland's best work. Harp-like keyboard notes pierce the clip of a bassline, plunging into deep dembow as elegantly as four-on-the-floor. Embracing de Casier's crystalline mezzo-soprano, \"Bikini\" pushes sound into pure sensation: sand between toes and lips on goose-pimpled skin. When she was a teenager, \"going to the swimming pool was the worst thing I could imagine,\" she told Mixmag in 2021. A decade-plus later, \"Bikini\" comes alive in the shedding of those inhibitions: why hedge around the pool, when you could head straight for the sea?Despite \"Bikini\"'s deft movement between shifting rhythmic patterns, the track still manages to capture a profound sense of pause. Trying to make sense of the changing tides—\"Lookin' out there / Tryin' to find a meaning\"—de Casier only finds herself recentered \"with the wind in my hair, just breathing in the air.\" It's these atmospheric tendencies that take \"Bikini\" from the track of September to the track of the year. Before León and de Casier, artists from Otis Redding to Kelela have gazed \"out there,\" hoping to find some sort of solace in the meeting of water and sky. And in a year so rife with misery, there are plenty of reasons to be fearful for the future. But \"Bikini\" charts a different course—it's a three-minute appeal to just be. - Hattie Lindert",

Yet the music's embrace of funk and even melody — a new string to their bow—underlines the duo's conviction that serious music doesn't have to take itself so seriously. - Chloe Lula",

The seven-tracker blends syncopated rhythms with gorgeous melodies, weaving flashes of dubstep and ambient textures into rave-ready form. Grime-indebted beats on tracks like “The Bills” could as readily host an MC as send a Detroit loft party into overdrive, while “Double Standard” combines shimmering synths with propulsive drums, making it well suited for introspective home listening or peak-time club play.

It's a fitting introduction to the musician's most accessible album yet, which largely forgoes the murky timbres and synth abstraction of her earlier works.Instead, tracks such as \"Oídos,\" where Fratti's sweet soprano springs above whining trumpet, have spawned comparisons to the jazzy angst of singer-songwriters like Fiona Apple. Or take \"Descubrimos un suspiro,\" where her voice is raw and up close as strings rustle against warm horns.

She's long picked over the question of what it means to make it. BRAT homes in on something of an answer: there's no \"it\" to make. Sell all the records you want, or don't—you have to come home to yourself either way. Might as well crank the bass and dance through it. - Sasha Geffen",

        "description": "Slamming body music from a true master who transmits the vivacity and nerve of Caribbean club culture: that's Bubbling Forever. On his second official collection of bubbling—a sped-up mutation of dancehall—Dutch-Surinamese producer De Schuurman builds on the genre's Afro-diasporic legacy with a clutch of tracks designed to whip up hysteria in the rave.\"Benniale Dakar\" starts with the ominous drama of an early Pop Smoke trap tune then launches into a rattling speed dembow. As smoky pads permeate the air, the beat decelerates into half-time—only a quick moment to gather your waist before the wine-inducing rhythms of \"Bubbling Meets Kaseko,\" which fuse bubbling's restless kicks with traditional Surinamese skratji percussion. On \"Stylez two,\" mischievous samples of Lil Jon's infamous \"OK!\" and KRS-One's \"Sound of da Police\" can jolt even the stiffest hips into work. When \"Scratchin\"'s pointillist synths plink around vocal samples of \"I'm just scratchin' the surface,\" you get the sense it's both a call to action and warning shot: Schuurman is here to stay. - Rachel Grace Almeida",

        "description": "Not waving, or drowning, but drifting. That's how 2024 felt for many of us: a serotonin crash made all the more raw by an increasingly cruel world. After years of clubland electrifying the masses with the shock of the new, we chose to lean the other way, prioritising cosy records that made you thankful for what you already have (a craving that, in alternative circles, drew people to the spectral-jukebox transmissions of Cindy Lee like moth to flame). Into this climate landed a masterclass in softer vibrations from Brian Leeds, who, as Huerco S. and Pendant, has already proved himself a master of suspended animation several times over. One Day both encapsulated the mood and cut through it like a beacon.Does it augur poorly for a culture built on progression to take a step back and recalibrate? Well, the past was priced in; Loidis is the ancient name for Leeds, after all. And though One Day was built around slippery micro rhythms and delayed dub stabs, Leeds hardly soapboxed for a return to subtlety. The strongest promo was essentially happenstance, after he termed the project \"dub mnml emo tech\" to wriggle out of anything too formal, but wound up perfectly articulating its playful vibe.Just as For Those Of You…'s truncated loops were a creative sleight-of-hand, One Day pulls off a sly trick throughout. Leeds mimics the lossy compression and audio degradation favoured by the clicks 'n cuts set, only this time using stem separation software and creative resampling that falls closer, he told us, to hypermodern genres. In doing so, he created a shapeshifting palette: all muzzled kicks, panned basslines bobbing through hyaline textures and indulgent codas tacked onto nine- or ten-minute tunes (\"Why Do,\" \"Love's Linneaments,\" \"Sugar Snot\") that you could have sworn flashed by in four. It scans as wrong at first blush, so you're compelled to run it back a dozen times—by which point, naturally, it sounds exceptional.One Day doesn't just revitalise styles that faded from favour; it glows with the patience of Shinchi Atobe and DJ Sprinkles, the frolic of Isolée and Dinky, the 3 AM soul-searching of Claro Intelecto and Paul St. Hilaire. Most obviously, the spirit of Alcachofa and Vocalcity feel hardcoded into its DNA. These are records that have meant a lot to people over the years, made by artists who have stood the test of time. I'd be lying if I didn't think Leeds is in that conversation now.When it arrived, One Day might have seemed too discrete to break out, but months of compulsive listening have upended that. If we're resting at a waystation en route to a destination as-yet-unclear, there was no more generous or agreeable companion. So while there aren't many conclusions to be drawn from the discomforting haze of 2024, this much is true: the album that felt primed to take a slow stroll to classic status has raced way ahead of schedule. It's already there. - Gabriel Szatan",

        "description": "At the shows for her new album, Kelela stood alone onstage. This was a deliberate choice, she explained, to have everything stripped back so audiences could see her—and hear her—for all she was. But up there, the blue lights around her dimmed, it was clear that her solitary figure also reflected her more bitter-than-sweet struggles against what she described as \"male stoicism.\" This remark came from the revelations she had while reading The Will to Change, an investigation of men, masculinity and love by the radical Black feminist scholar bell hooks. Her epiphany was painstakingly reflected in the dancehall derivation \"On The Run\": \"You get around enough / Too busy actin' tough / Give me a softer side / I won't wait all night.\" Patriarchal culture doesn't only hurt women, Kelela discovered—it also restricts the way men are able to explore intimacy and achieve wholeness for themselves.\n\nI saw Kelela perform in Berlin. 13 of Raven's 15 tracks were produced there, and it shows. There's a sorrow and solemnity woven into the city's monochromatic corners that echo through Raven, like a pebble rattling in an empty aluminium can. Even the title track is underpinned by a spacious yearning, as if on the brink of a breaking point—\"Took all my labour / Don't tell me that I'm strong,\" she sings, before gradually trotting into a heaving 4/4 beat, a subtle nod to clubbing as escapism. By the album's conclusion, \"Far Away,\" Kelela finds her deliverance in the form of honeyed ad-libs undulating over sounds of crashing waves, as if signalling that with enough time and perspective, all pain can be alchemised into pure spirit. -Whitney Wei",

Through visceral lyrics that underline the idea of desire as a truly physical sensation, the ex-Chairlift vocalist sings of self-indulgent surrender to a lover without the slightest care of appearing desperate or needy. But it's the production—from Polachek and Danny L. Harle—that truly makes this a multifaceted pop record: feathery drum & bass, flamenco, dreamy rock and bassy R&B bops add to the physicality of Polachek's feelings, pushing her theatrical vocals outside of the shielded realm of inner thoughts and into the material world. -Nyshka Chandran\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

This all culminated with Imagine This Is A High Dimensional Space Of All Possibilities, which marks a welcome return to the club for Holden—or his version of it, anyway. Recognisable dance music tropes (hints of dub techno, echoes of house, microdoses of rave) nestle into the rich and complex instrumentation that gives all of Holden's music its distinctive flair.

All the familiar hallmarks of Tirzah are there—understated vocals and a sound rooted in \"disarming simplicity\"—but here everything is notched up to a new, more physical intensity. Each track packs a smouldering punch and Levi's distorted piano melodies on tracks like \"F22\" and \"Promises\" have Grand Cru earworm qualities. The album turns Tirzah and Levi's often ramshackle songs into a steamrolling train that tugs at the heartstrings all the harder, while still holding onto the lightweight feel that makes all of the project's music so enchanting. -Conor McTernan\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

Regal86, a buzzy producer from Monterrey makes all kinds of music, but he's particularly good at hardgroove. His album La Onda landed at the perfect time to take the revival to the next level. With breathless sequencing and expert programming, this is hard, fast dance music that doesn't bludgeon you over the head, but instead invites you to dance and get lost in its intricacies.

According to local producer Nondi_, those who were left behind—like herself—now live in limbo, floating between boredom and a constant fear of when the next flood will strike. On her ambient juke LP Flood City Trax, cutesy, cotton-cloud FX meet frenetic footwork percussion to convey a conflicting and distant depiction of a place that's been left for dead by the rest of the world, yet stubbornly lives on. -Joseph Francis\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

The OG producer and Basic Channel collaborator resurfaced this March with nine exquisite tracks that show off his mastery of subtle, politically charged grooves. Touching on downtempo, minimal techno, roots reggae and dancehall, Tikiman Vol.1 runs the gamut genre-wise while delivering concise commentary on displacement, education and memory. Fuzzy dub tones on \"Keep Safe\" and \"The Weather Man\" give way to chuggier cuts like \"In Door,\" with St. Hilaire's mesmeric vocals and streamlined basslines acting as key transition tools throughout. Still instantly recognisable, the dub techno MC has a way of making dreamy, '90s-style atmospheres feel fresh with carefully leftfield touches. -Nyshka Chandran\n\nListen:\nBandcamp",

And then she was kind of stuck with it, until it became her defining instrument of the decade so far. On Atlas, her first so-called ambient album, she takes her piano and the sounds of collaborators on strings and explodes it into sonic dust. Those particles are rearranged into gentle compositions that inhale and exhale like a living respiratory system, with melodies that appear like clouds on the horizon before rolling away and letting the music clear up again. Atlas takes the fearless compositional framework of past albums and her ear for slight-but-dazzling melodies and presents them in a new, almost neoclassical way. It's another excellent entry in one of dance music's most wonderfully unpredictable discographies. -Andrew Ryce\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

The slow-burning LP unravels like a gentle love letter, pairing intuitive, staccato drums with conversational vocals and lush instrumentation (guitar and woodwinds). There are hints of jazz, trap and dub techno—perhaps a reference to batida's own cross-pollination from various Angolan and Portuguese styles—and a thread of tenderness and toughness.

Madres deftly combines house music with field recordings from indigenous communities, the Peruvian cajón drum, clips from a protest against homophobia and pan-Latin American rhythms. Kourtesis makes restorative, kaleidoscopic house music that blooms from her heart and tugs at the strings of others, highlighting the power of dance floor healing.\n-Katie Thomas\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music",

For me, it's house dancing, getting free on the beat with a friend [you] made on the dance floor.\" The 108th edition of the Honcho Podcast Series, delivered by Jones as a special Pride mix, encapsulates this feeling—the joy of dancing, moving your body in sync with the kindred spirit on the dance floor you met just moments ago. Full of piano riffs, sensual vocals and a whole lot of groove, Kilopatrah Jones's Honcho offering is an hour of brilliant, ecstatic house that will make you dance until you sweat. —Katie Thomas",

It's also entirely possible that Joyce owns a 12-inch that somehow overlays sweeping chords with gurning rave stabs, rolling hand drums and short-circuiting electrical currents. The fact that we'll likely never know the answer is part of the fun (plus, it's not like we'd be able to find any of the records he plays anyways). This two-hour treasure trove of all things '90s sees Joyce in particularly bouncy and jubilant form. There are Latin-flavored rhythms, vintage NY vocals, and little bits of proper late night garage. The mixing is seamless without being showy, and Joyce keeps us on the edge of our seats the whole time, wondering what Shazam-breaking gem he'll reach for next. —H.I.",

The Miami producer is at the forefront of a new wave of 305-area artists who fuse together the city's unique tapestry of Hispanic cultures—and its deep connections to Latin America—with its robust dance music history. León specifically mixes influences from reggaeton and perreo into what is sometimes termed \"Latin tribal techno,\" but whatever you want to call it, there's no denying the appeal of \"Xtasis,\" the track most of us heard out on dance floors more than any other, by a country mile.\n \n\"Xtasis,\" a collaboration with Venezuelan raptor house pioneer DJ Babatr, is a good example of the intercontinental cross-pollination happening within this scene. The percussion plays a trick, both four-on-the-floor and broken at the same time, at a chemically-enhanced pace with distant vocal wails that add a lysergic flair. But \"Xtasis\"—and its accompanying Pearson Sound and Doctor Jeep remixes—really clicks with the old-school organ bassline that drops in at about the two-minute mark. It's something so simple, so familiar and, frankly, genius, that by the time the kick drum drops back in, the room should be in a frenzy. If it isn't, then you're probably in the wrong place. —Andrew Ryce\n \nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud",

The single marked a new direction for the London duo, setting them apart from their peers by creating a completely singular sound where bubblegum pop meets UK bass. A frothing breakbeat at 160 BPM drives the track under its SOPHIE-reminiscent vocal, meanwhile its neon melodies burst like fireworks across the stereo spectrum. \"home\" will be remembered the way \"Hyph Mango\" was, marking the entrance into some unknown, but exciting era of UK club music. —H.I. \n \nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

Underground club producers have long played out cheeky edits of '90s chart-toppers in their DJ sets, but it felt more prominent this year. Under his KH alias, Four Tet brilliantly reworks 3LW's \"No More (Baby I'ma Do Right),\" autotuning the original lispy vocals against a mean bass synth and a cooing, sparkling melody that feels straight out of a nursery rhyme.

The revival of genres like jungle and trance, among others, is proof positive, and the subject of many articles from cultural critics like Simon Reynolds and Mark Fisher. But there's a distinction to be made here. Some artists' chase of rose-tinted nostalgia is nothing more than empty cliché, while others treat their return to a bygone era like a hero's journey—familiar, yet eclipsed by a new, fortified sensibility.\n\nD. Tiffany and Roza Terenzi achieve the ideal balance on their debut album, Edge Of Innocence. It offers a mélange of influences that run the hi-BPM gamut from electro to drum & bass without losing grip of the rippling, psychedelic groove at the core of everything this duo do. \"Grains Of Sand\" is a case in point, replete with synths that stab through a thicket of lumbering percussion, as is the fittingly named breakbeat bop \"Redemption Arc,\" kitted out with all the sleek dynamism that emerges after a period of dark contemplation. By the end of Edge Of Innocence, you get the feeling that, though the duo are working with well-worn sounds, they've made them all their own. -Whitney Wei\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

By the time she brings it home on the closer, \"#513,\"  she's delivered a defiant manifesto of hedonism, joy and femininity that raises the bar when it comes to post-genre pop music. -E.O.\n\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

An extension of a book of verse of the same name, Tongues takes stock of decades of violence and its effects on the bodies and minds of a people, but also recognizes the power one can possess in even the most hopeless of circumstances. Combining her traditional throat singing with English words wielded like daggers, it's a disarming and personal listen that makes the historical personal, underlining the scale of a tragedy but also the resilience and power of those who have survived it. -A.R.\n\n\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

The Red Hunter broadens this palette to include touches of hip-hop and contemporary club music, while keeping the nuts and bolts of classic Detroit in place. The result is the best full-length of her career. On The Red Hunter she creates a singular cosmology where strange, stuttering drum patterns emerge underneath windswept melodies and contracting basslines. But even as she moves into far-flung realms, she never loses sight of the club, and almost every single one of these tracks would make a head-turning standout in a DJ set—which is what we've always come to Steffi for in the first place. -H.I.\n\n\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

It's inspired by the sounds of his adopted home of London, and to his credit, it captures what makes the city so enduring in dance music history. A restless blend of sound system culture, American and European imports and the kind of vocal hooks you hear on BBC Radio 1—with a few vocal turns from the man himself—it transforms Mall Grab from bedroom producer into something closer to a pop star. -A.R.\n\n\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

The album's accompanying press text loftily asserts that its ten tracks are \"considerations of the machine-human interface\" and \"transformative mental, psychological and transgenerational states.\" While some of these (perhaps overwrought) academic themes come through in the album's titles, it mostly sounds like the duo's mood piece-like electro fare—in the best possible way. The tracks throughout Neurotelepathy aren't predictable arrangements made for club play. They're spare and considered, making exquisite use of spatial sound design, spectral percussion and arpeggiated melodies.

Examining Opal's cover gives a strong sense of the sounds within. 11 tracks of sharp (though sometimes soft), complex and unpredictable electronic sculptures, a world of intricate sound design that Batu said he intended to feel vivid and transportive. Like so many LPs released this year, Opal is a lockdown record, made when Batu was in an introspective and contemplative state of mind, experimenting with moving away from club 12-inches and into a space more vulnerable and experimental. -K.T.\n\n\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

The album is brighter than anything we'd heard from twigs before. Gone is the operatic austerity of MAGDALENE. Instead, Caprisongs  is a pop album with a capital P. The album mines from Afrobeats, grime, baile funk and R&B. It also sources from her personal life via snippets of conversations she recorded with loved ones. The immersive world she creates here deals with insecurity, \"stupid boys\" and friendship, but it's also celebratory. The world had opened up, after all. Twigs might have had a cry now and then, but at least she was doing it on the dance floor in the album's first single, \"Tears In The Club.\". As phenomenal as Caprisongs is, it's somehow even more impressive because it was pulled off with a welcome sense of humour. The album title, for example, is inspired by astrology—her \"stubborn Caprisun ass telling her to work through the pain.\" Listeners can even eavesdrop on an astrological reading by the album's close. Sometimes, a little stubbornness is worth it. -K.M.\n\n\n\n\nListen:\nApple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

And he doesn't just talk to talk. Many DJs claim to play across genres, but there are \"many DJs\" and then there is Theo Parrish. Over the past few years, the historically private artist has given fans a near-unprecedented view into his creative mind, first with the lengthy and unclassifiable sonic essay-meets-radio drama We Are All Georgeous Monsterss, and then this year with a six-and-a-half hour mix for NTS called \"Eargoggles.\" (Parrish also dropped another six-hour mix close to press time.) \n\nEargoggles is a marathon celebration of the infinite diversity of Black music, spanning from hard bop to hip-hop, searing psych rock to roots reggae. No random grab bag, this is a grand narrative and the revelation of a modern canon of soul with appearances by James Brown, The Congos and D'Angelo. The mix is an education unto itself—around hour five Parrish drops \"Jazz Cats Part 1,\" a cut consisting of Madlib breathlessly laying out his key jazz influences—yet it's also a generous statement of purpose bursting with joy and urgency.\n\n25 years into his career, Parrish gives us an exhaustive guide to the music that makes him tick, that has informed his own enduring classics. But why now? He explains the gravity of his convictions in the final moment of the magisterial \"Eargoggles\" mix:\n\nI'm hoping that at some point during this... After you've had a ride, a musical ride with me, that you take a moment to consider the troubles that you have, and consider that you're lucky to have them.\n\nEven if it doesn't affect you demographically, you should seriously consider the fact that there's an urgency that should be lived, in respect for those that get taken from us early under the guise of 'serve and protect.'\n\nSo let's survive together. But let's remember them together as well. Let's not forget how we treat each other when the music's playing and how things change when the lights go on and we all go back to the rest of our lives.\n\nLet's go back with a little more urgency and care for the fellow man. Let's give a damn a little bit. And if we can do that, we got a better place.—Matt McDermott",

After innovating an often-imitated, never-replicated brand of deep house around the turn of the millennium, Wuddaji's eight tracks felt like a new milestone, or a jumping off point for some new, deliriously funky Black dance music. Dense, futuristic tunes like \"Hennyweed Buckdance\" are interspersed with floor-fillers like \"Angry Purple Birds\" and \"This is For You.\" Wuddaji came with a map of Idlewild, a once-thriving vacation enclave in Northwestern Michigan that saw the likes of Aretha Franklin and Louis Armstrong performing for Black audiences escaping segregation in St. Louis and Detroit. Wuddaji, like so much of his music, draws from the personal and the historical, musical and otherwise. His deep understanding of the triumphs and injustices of the past—and their impact on the present—is raw material for groundbreaking art.\n\nListen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud  / Sound Signature",

These records come out once every five years or so, are always named after flowers and feature elementary artwork that looks like it was made in Microsoft Paint (a stretched flower and clashing text). But beneath that exterior is some of the best work the American multi-instrumentalist has ever put out. Rebirth Of Gerberdaisy is no exception. In fact, it's the best BOOF record yet, with the gusto of a talented live band trying to work out as many dance genres as they can: minimal techno, piano house, stomping disco, jazz fusion and deep, soulful grooves. Of course it's not a band you're hearing, just Fulton going crazy on the organ, guitar and keyboards, a one-of-a-kind talent that makes every genre sound like something he invented.\n\nListen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

On Workaround, South London-born artist Beatrice Dillon embraces the collectivity of music-making, weaving together acoustic instrumentation from 12 different collaborators with her software production techniques to create 14 rhythmically complex toe-tappers, all fixed at 150 BPM. Batu brings the hi-hats on \"Workaround Six,\" which are nonchalantly assembled into a beat, while the malevolent thwack of stand-up bass comes courtesy of Swedish jazz musician Petter Eldh. \"Workaround Two\" has flushed synths and vocals from Laurel Halo. Dillon's catalogue is an advent calendar of distinct treats, containing dub techno abstractions such as 2015's Face A, experimental cassettes like Index Tape For Performance and Two Changes (with Rupert Clervaux). Workaround, galvanized by a crush on UK dance music, is cultivated through the diligent practice of purposeful limitation. \n\nListen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

Curated by Physical Therapy, Umfang and Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson, the music was exceptional—27 tracks of bold club sounds, plus the odd bit of noise and ambient, from a cast of artists that spanned continents and generations. The series' tradition of what it once called \"electronic protest music\" had never felt more necessary, and it was inspiring to see electronic artists rising to the occasion so readily.

On \"Money Can't Buy,\" her guest Nappy Nina says, \"Snuggly and sleepy / These naps come easy\" after a verse of braggadoccio.

But for every moment of foreboding, there's a glimpse of light, underpinned by an elastic, almost buoyant sense of melody and rhythm, informed by her days in the Bay Area's vogue scene and the taut slap of ballroom music.

Taken from an arsenal of a whopping 74 tracks made during quarantine, the UK producer compiled 84 minutes of summery UK dance music into this mix, which fans out over UK funky, 2-step garage, dubstep and jungle. The edit samples range from '90s hip-hop and R&B to the TikTok favorite \"Renegade,\" which is remixed with raucous amen breaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConducta\nThe Kiwi Sound\n\nTwo years, two unbelievably good mixes from Conducta. The Kiwi Sound, the follow-up to 2019's #1 pick, hits many of the same notes: bouncy, bright and stacked with the best in fresh UK garage. It's a bold statement on the health of the modern scene, which has taken years to break through despite UK garage never really going away. Finally, everyone's favourite summer sound is back where it belongs: in the hands of young, talented tastemakers with the world at their feet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAUZIA\nDISCWOMAN 87 \n\n\"Almost didn't do this as I didn't think it was good enough,\" FAUZIA says of her DISCWOMAN mix, \"but my friends forced me to see it through!\" The idea of this all-originals mix not being good enough becomes almost impossible to conceive about halfway through, when she's blasted her way through Plaid-style IDM, throbbing deep house and stonking dubstep. The mix seems to catch the artist just as she's found her voice, like a bolt of lightning captured in a photograph. As tracks from it have trickled out on various releases through the year, FAUZIA's star has only grown brighter. This mix, frozen in time, is basically where it all started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScott Zacharias & Patrick Russell\nIT.podcast.s09e05 & IT.podcast.s09e01\n\nFor a small but dedicated group within rave culture, it goes without saying that No Way Back, arguably the last vestige of the hallowed Midwest rave tradition, is the biggest event, of any kind, on the calendar all year. These two sets from this year's streamed edition show what's unique about the party, from the range of records played, to the peerless taste and panache of their selectors. Patrick Russell's set embodies No Way Back's bread and butter: leftfield techno and electro gems, drawn from decades of dedicated digging, perfectly arranged into a mind-bending slipstream of sound. Scott Zacharias, who usually plays the chillout room (\"Outer Space\") at sunrise, is the party's dessert, bringing a psychedelic soup of jazz, rock, dub, hip-hop, ambient, Italo, funk, soul and whatever else fits a sound he likes to call \"sleaze.\" Together, these sets demonstrate the limitless possibilities not just of No Way Back, but of playing records in general. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Jobse\nSunrise at the last ever Nachtdigital \n\nAll 140 minutes of this glorious mix encapsulate why we’ve been missing clubbing so much in 2020. It has everything: pop hits, rave classics, the hiss of the Nachtdigital crowd cavorting in the dawn sun. Early on, the heavens opened, followed by hours of unabated sunshine. Friends frollicked in the lake, partners kissed and embraced, and Job Jobse, the master of ceremonies, surveyed the sandy dance floor with the grin of a man whose dreams had come true. Listening to this mix brings it all flooding back. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuliana Huxtable\nDekmantel 288\n\nTo take a line from one of her own poems, Juliana Huxtable’s Dekmantel Podcast contains a \"PALPABLY HIGH LEVEL OF IDGAF ENERGY.\" The Texas-born artist is impatient behind the decks, knocking through visceral techno, vocal samples and industrial interventions with marvelous fluidity, compounding them into a hypnotizing sound collage that advances towards evermore stimulating sonic extremes. Change is a constant in this mix, and no genre is out of bounds. The permissive approach means it's packed with potential peak moments, poised and ready to encite euphoria for a range of listeners, whatever their niche. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNicolas Lutz\nat Phonoteque\n\nNicolas Lutz has long been the maestro of playing records for which you'd happily trade a limb in return for an ID. Thanks to him and peers like Binh and DJ Masda, overlooked corners of house, techno, electro, trance and breakbeat history are now prime influences for a burgeoning audience of DJs and producers, many of whom might not have formerly paid mind to the so-called \"minimal\" scene from which those DJs emerged. This mix from Phonotheque—home base for Lutz, DJ Koolt and the rest of the Montevideo techno scene—shows things are coming full circle. More than ever, Lutz is playing new music that his sound has directly influenced. He's also reaching for records that fit into his taste bracket but come from sources you might not expect. It would've been unusual a few years ago that he'd play something by, say, Overmono. It speaks to how different parts of dance music are coming ever closer into orbit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheo Parrish\nWe Are All Gorgeous Monsterss\n\nTheo Parrish's We Are All Georgeous Monsterss is more than a DJ mix: it's a casually delivered manifesto. In the fever pitch of the largest protest movement in US history, Parrish uploaded, revised and eventually pulled down an expansive six-part set that drew direct connections between racial violence and the appropriation of electronic dance music from its Black roots. \"You don't know what this music means to us, you only know what it means to you,\" Parrish intoned. \"Now granted, you take your ideas, you run with it, you create your own shit, that's great, you create your own universe of it. Please, go right ahead, there's nothing wrong with being inspired, but my god, you can't have all of it!\" Quotes and archival interviews break up Parrish's own spoken word as he unfurls hours of unreleased material, spanning from melancholy jazz piano to frenetic beat tracks. All the while, the Detroit artist detailed various indignities, from being pulled over to getting kicked off the decks at Berghain. If this is what Parrish, a massively respected innovator within the form, faces day-to-day, what does that say about the general experience of Black artists within the club scene? What went wrong?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCL\nBlowing Up The Workshop 111\n\nDJing isn't always art, but Blowing Up The Workshop, Matthew Kent's dearly departed mix series, reminded us that it often can be. The series was historically important, hosting mixes from Galcher Lustwerk and Ben UFO that stood the test of time. But the series also helped migrate the concept of DJing away from the utilitarian and towards the deeply personal. CCL's contribution to 111—the seven mixes that sent BUTW out on a high note—fit the bill. Kent described the set, which spanned from dream pop to dubstep, as \"a beautiful collage that feels like the reason I started the series in the first place.\" Akash pulled together a wistful 30-minute set of Bollywood tunes for 111, complementing Chris SSG's masterful three-hour ambient set and Dr Banana's moody garage and 2-step mix, to name just a few. BUTW felt like a natural home for all of these disparate styles, and this freedom often led to mixes worth cherishing. Kent's now moved on from BUTW, focusing on Mana Records, the label he runs with Andrea Zarza, but with any luck, BUTW's boundless approach will persevere.",

Summerhill, in the shimmering track \"I Dream So Loud.\" \"I've seen dreams deferred / As many times as I've seen kids wish upon them…. Now / Not later but right now / More than ever I dream so loud.\" In the next track, we hear a one-off vocal sample: \"Can't we rebel or something?\" Those words stay in our head as we listen to the rich, unpredictable, deeply personal mix that follows.\n\nThe beauty of DJing is you can play literally whatever you want, something that Josey Rebelle, a DJ since the age of 13, understands more deeply than most. Josey In Space, the second official mix in Tim Sweeney's Beats In Space series, has the same eclectic flex as her club and radio sets, drawing an arc from '90s hardcore to chilled UK hip-hop via house, techno, acid and jungle. But it's also highly focussed, bringing together these disparate sounds to give us something carefully considered: a paean to Black club music over the last few decades, from both sides of the Atlantic. \n\n\"Yes, music is beautiful, it makes you happy,\" Rebelle told Chal Ravens this year in a cover story for DJ Mag. \"But it's also a serious business, and you approach those decks with serious intentions to destroy the dance floor.\" Here, Rebelle's intentions are less dance floor destruction, more musical storytelling. But the dedication to craft is no less intense. Arriving one year after the BBC's #1 Essential Mix of 2019, Josey In Space once again shows Rebelle to be one of her generation's best.",

Not only that but your track is exceptionally festival-ready, all cosmic synths and fat breakbeats—the soundtrack, in other words, to a life-affirming dance floor moment. The good news is that \"Outer Rim\" isn't likely to be shelved any time soon. Tracks this special deserve a proper runout once parties return. Ravers must experience this beautiful banger in all its glory.\n\nListen: Youtube",

His 2020 mini-album, Sankofa Season, was well worth the wait, especially with the added bonus of broken-beat hero Kaidi Tatham on the buttons. \"Washed In You,\" the effortlessly cool lead single, is everything you could wish for from the collaboration. Tatham's production pedigree shines through the skippy drums and roaming arrangement. His lush keyboard playing is the perfect accompaniment to Ashong's voice, as well as having its own moments to take centre stage. Sankofa Season marked the beginning of a new label project for the pair, Kitto Records. Hopefully there's more to come, and sooner rather than later.\n\nListen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

Aqueduct, their only release this year, shows what makes this label cult favorite, with six tracks that float between cosmic techno and a modern update of '90s West Coast ambient (see: Spacetime Continuum and his essential label, Reflective). \"548\" hovers gracefully between those sounds. Its atmosphere is part deep-sea, part deep-space, with a stepping techno pulse that enhances its weightless feel and a nine-minute runtime that makes it easy to get lost in. These guys do lush, transportive techno better than anyone, and this one showed them at the top of their game.",

The austerity of their last label, Works The Long Nights, is a distant memory. That's not to say the new music doesn't bang as hard, but the pair seem intent on drawing more fun and unusual sounds out of their arsenal of hardware. \"Shoes Off\" is Exhibit A. Somehow a playful melody, gritty kicks and rips of bass gel together.

Turns out, their styles complement each other. \"Straight Murder (Giggs & David),\" their second collaboration, showed both rappers at the top of their games, Dave relentless and razor-sharp, Giggs somehow both jovial and vicious. The wordplay is mind-blowing. And let's give a special shout-out to KeyzMusic, the man behind one of the best and most chilling beats of 2020.\n\nListen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia Jordan\nFor You \nLocal Action\n\n\n\nIndia Jordan wrote For You to document the process of coming to terms with their queer identity. Taking cues from happy hardcore, drum & bass and house, the record opens with blissful house tracks \"I'm Waiting (Just 4 U)\" and the title track, recalling the late-night euphoria of last year's DNT STP MY LV. The \"you\" here refers to Jordan, who has recently come out to the public as non-binary.\n\nThere's a feeling of triumph that emanates from \"For You.\" The track shows Jordan's knack for chopping and looping vocal samples, this one employing the amorous hook of Change's \"You Are My Melody.\" The loop never gets old, and as satisfying as the final climactic breakdown of the track is, when the familiar hook comes back around, it makes you wonder why it left in the first place. But the vocals aren't all that make the track pop. \"For You\" is swaddled in an addictive sunny feeling, thanks to funky guitar riffs, seesawing '80s synths and rousing percussion. The track captures the dizzying joy of finding true love—in this case, the love of one's self. \n\n\nListen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif(window && !!window.LazyLoad){new window.LazyLoad({elements_selector:\".lazy\"});}",

        "description": "Kelela & Asmara\nAquaphoria\n\nOriginally aired as part of Warp's NTS takeover, Kelela and Asmara's Warp mixtape feels like a jam session between friends. Asmara sculpts an undulating backing track out of music from Aphex Twin, Suzanne Kraft & Jonny Nash and Kareem Lotfy—artists that have helped define the recent era of ambient music. Kelela's airy, improvised vocals act are the perfect counterpart to Jaco Pastorius' genius bass solo and Iury Lech's emotional washes. They bring this floating, beatless music to an unforgettable climax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLena Willikens & Vladimir Ivkovic\nLive: Nuits Sonores 2019\n\nHeadlining festival sets don't always work outside the original setting—as with well-timed jokes, you kinda had to be there. But leave it to Lena Willikens and Vladimir Ivkovic to make their three-hour Nuits Sonores odyssey suit nearly any context. It's meditative, weird and, lest we forget the main room dance floor it soundtracked, banging. Filled with the pair's characteristic slower selections, this mix feels like swimming inside a crystal ball. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCL\nUnsound Podcast 56\n\nCCL called this mix a \"regurgitated memory\" of their Honcho Campout set, reflecting on the \"more twisted hours… before the light had come up.\" That predawn unpredictability is what's so exciting here. One highlight is their adept pulling back with Codek's \"Closer\" before diving into a Metalheadz Wax Doctor rush. With these unreal transitions, and touches like the experimental Polish music that bookends the mix (a nod to Unsound) CCL shows the careful craft that sets them apart. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruly Madly\nGHOSTCAST 006\n\nGhostcast, a mix series from Berlin's favourite record store on wheels, has only released a few recordings since launching two years ago, but each is a window into a world of deep-digging DJs with exquisite house and techno collections. Truly Madly is one of them. An underground favourite who's steadily gaining recognition outside the world of trainspotters and Discogs geeks, the Londoner's set traverses classic techno, electro and house, cloaked with the same spacey charm that colours his club sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoards Of Canada\nSocietas x Tape (NTS x Warp 30)\n\nBoards Of Canada are two of the most reclusive artists in electronic music, which means we don't know much about what they listen to during long stays in the Scottish countryside. Their Societas x Tape mix, a two-hour set broadcast on NTS as part of Warp's 30th anniversary, gives us an idea. Obscure electronics by Filmmaker, '80s post-punk by Killing Joke and synth-pop from Severed Heads tell us a little bit more about these pioneers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDee Diggs\nFACT Mix 710\n\nNew York's Dee Diggs is on a quest to remind everyone that dance music is black music. Her FACT mix is her fiery mission statement, cutting through the history of black dance music, from Paris Is Burning and vintage acts like DJ Deeon and Karizma to NYC's new guard, including upstarts like Devoye and AceMo. This mix is classic, soulful and banging in all the right places, securing Diggs' own place in the canon she's charting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEris Drew\nRaving Disco Breaks Vol. 1\n\nOn this year's funkiest mixtape, Eris Drew made some of dance music's most classic sounds her own. Raving Disco Breaks is composed of dance classics chopped into breaks on-the-fly by the American DJ, showcasing not only her impressive technical skills but also the emotional, spiritual and often nostalgic flair that makes her sets so electrifying. It's old-school technique with a new-school vibe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco Del Garda\nRobert Johnson Archive 0002\n\nFrancesco Del Garda played this set at Robert Johnson on the banks of the Rhine a few days after Christmas last year. He couldn't have asked for a better setting: sun rising, perfect soundsystem, six-hour time slot, festive crowd. This recording, an edition of the Frankfurt club's new mix series, gives us only an hour of it, but it shows Del Garda on fire, indulging the uplifting sound that distinguishes him from his contemporaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatu\nTruancy Volume 240\n\nBatu describes his Truancy mix as the closing set for a \"festival in 2030 called Bristol-Bass.\" Given his Timedance label and his own inventive productions, he's in a good position to imagine the future of UK dance music. The mix’s backbone wiggles and booms with modern bass music, while making adventurous jumps from Latin and Afro-Caribbean rhythms to ambient techno and experimental club.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErika\nIT.podcast.s08e01\n\nErika's Interdimensional Transmissions podcast from March really lives up to the Detroit label's name: it sounds like you're hearing an actual transmission from another dimension. IT does down-the-rabbithole techno better than anyone, and this recording of Erika at an LA showcase for sister label Eye Teeth shows the sound at its cosmic, funky, head-spinning best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDJ Persuasion\nDedicated To The Dedicated 94-95\n\nAsk any junglist worth their salt: 1994 and '95 were the golden years. Disagree? Well, you might feel differently after listening to Dedicated To The Dedicated 94-95, the latest hour-long mix by '90s dance music fanatic DJ Persuasion, AKA Semtek. Every tune, most of them near-impossible to track down, writhes with rhythm and soul. The warm basslines and time-stretched vocals spark tingles of euphoria. When people say the '90s were better, this is the kind of thing they're thinking of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSherelle\nLDN: Bass & Percs Special\n\nEarlier this year, Sherelle's debut Boiler Room session—a whirlwind of footwork, jungle and grime—went viral. While it's easy for some high BPM DJs to tire out their audience, her set maintains an addictive high energy throughout, with explosive, playful transitions that sparked the dance music equivalent of a mosh pit. Wait for the gutsy rewind at 23:40 that shot her to instant (and deserved) fame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeif\nFreerotation 2019\n\nLeif is part of a small group of DJs whose yearly sets at Freerotation festival in Wales always feel like a big deal. 2019 was no exception. In this recording, Leif redefines the peak-time set, starting slow and spindly before moving gracefully through many shades of cosy, rhythmic club music. There are tunes by Equiknoxx and Domu, Efdemin and Aphex Twin, all stitched together with extraordinary skill. As one SoundCloud commenter put it: \"are you even human.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Rubinstein\nPhonica Mix Series 56\n\nDr. Rubinstein is like an acid historian, wading through decades of dance music history to find the best 303 lines ever put to wax. Yet she still finds time in her Phonica mix to highlight several up-and-coming talents (Jack Roland, Gian) alongside more familiar names (DMX Krew, Adapta). Sometimes dark, sometimes bright, Phonica Mix Series 56 was a deeply psychedelic trip, weaving excellent electro and techno between forgotten acid bombs. As always with Rubinstein, the mixing was world-class, each transition bringing us further into her unique sound world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeon Vynehall\nDJ-Kicks\n\nLast year, Leon Vynehall released Nothing Is Still, showing the world that his production chops extended way beyond the club. In 2019 he did something similar, but with DJing. His proof this time is a spellbinding DJ-Kicks mix, which blends genres, eras and moods together with sublime flow and dexterity. Dancehall, techno, pop, jungle, soul, a solo piano piece—what could've been a hot mess ends up as one of the classiest mix CDs in recent memory. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nre:ni\nDekmantel Podcast 253\n\nre:ni's Dekmantel podcast does everything right. The tracklist left the sleuths at mixesdb mostly stumped. The mixing is inspired, moving swiftly through tempos and styles with quick sleights of hand and extended blends. More than anything, though, its re:ni's ineffable sense of groove—slinky, fluid, always in flux—that makes this one really pop off. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurtle Bugg\nHNYPOT 330: African Art of Acid (Triple A Baybee) Mixx\n\nTurtle Bugg's Honey Soundsystem mix makes a point so simple it often goes unsaid: black people invented acid house. And yet, as he puts it, \"There was no Second Summer Of Love in Amerikkka, no Ibiza for Negroes to spend their holiday, no beginnings of a multi-million dollar industry that could change the lives of Lady Liberty's bastard children.\" The voices of Dave Chappelle, Malcolm X and Derrick May ring out over interlocking acid lines. The message is clear: black ingenuity thrives, no matter who is paying attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen UFO\nHessle Audio - 9th September 2019\n\nWhat makes this Hessle Audio show, one of many hosted by Ben UFO in 2019, so special? Well, it just is. On that early autumn night, armed with a stack of fresh wax, the UK DJ was on particularly impressive form, treating regulars and first-timer listeners to a beautifully woven tapestry of ambient, Afro techno, jungle and Joe. When it aired, it wasn't just nerds and ravers listening, either—Four Tet, Hunee, John Talabot and other dance music dons had all tuned in for their weekly dose of musical inspiration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVia App\nCrack Mix 307\n\nVia App taps into the elemental energy of Brooklyn's techno underground on this mix for Crack, a set as volatile as any of their recent productions. This bumpy ride through jarring turns and interruptions, with its snarling, punkish spirit, hit harder than most other mixes we heard this year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/reviews/23502\">Powder In Space by Powder</a>\n\n\n\n\nPowder\nPowder In Space\n\nYou play Powder In Space once. You think, \"This is nice.\" You leave it for a while, then play it a second and third time. You notice things like the Roy Brooks vocal, or Daphne's bubbling vibraphone melody, that you didn't catch the first time. You also realize you've fallen in love with it. This is how Powder's mix gets under your skin: her unobtrusive approach, drawn from offbeat house with gorgeous textures, waits for you to come around to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShannen SP\nDISCWOMAN 80\n\nAlongside Kode9, Shannen SP runs Hyperdub's Ø events at London's Corsica Studios, a wonderful monthly midweek showcase of experimental music and art. She's quickly become a DJ to watch, and this mix for Discwoman showcases her knack for linking together sharp, angular beats with loose percussive rhythms—a style she sums up as \"witchy black energy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCiel\nFACT Mix 724\n\nCindy Li's FACT mix has a specific concept: \"fast & light,\" inspired by hummingbirds. It also captures what makes her DJing so dynamic. The Toronto artist makes breakbeat, electro and techno float like feathers on the breeze, moving through quick-footed drum patterns and fluttering melodies with finesse. Her technique changes the feel of the music itself, which is among the highest compliments you can pay a DJ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Therapy\nLive: Honcho Campout 2019\n\nThe Way In may have had the freakiest sounds at this year's Honcho Campout. Hours before CCL brought the dance floor to tears with Beat Happening, Physical Therapy unfurled this masterclass in trippy eclecticism. Cuts of perfectly dreamy drum & bass, a slo-mo version of Cece Peniston's \"Finally\" layered over Stenny’s \"Stress Test,\" Andrew Weatherall's remix of St Etienne, D'Angelo's \"Devil's Pie\"—the highlights in this one are simply too many to name. From a punter's perspective, hearing a DJ with such unique style going for it like this is basically as good as it gets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJosey Rebelle\nEssential Mix\n\n\"The thread that runs through the music I play, and my whole life, comes from my parent's generation,\" Josey Rebelle told us in 2017's Real Scenes: London film. Her parents are part of the Windrush generation, which arrived in the UK from the Caribbean in the 1950s and went on to make an inestimable impact on British life and culture. Rebelle's heritage pours out the speakers every time she's behind the decks. She's a quintessential London DJ: informed by the city's record shop and soundsystem culture, she's comfortable weaving together soul, techno, house, disco, R&B and jungle. Her first Essential Mix was dark and funky, with deep US music from Jamal Moss and Aybee featuring alongside London favourites Steven Julien and Cooly G.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAriel Zetina\nTruancy Volume 249\n\n\"Power to them sexy transsexuals out there, transforming the world,\" a woman intones in the opening moments of Ariel Zetina’s Truancy mix. It's one of many vivid vocal samples that contribute to the smartbar resident's sense of narrative. Beneath them, trippy acid house and soulful techno—much of it produced by other queer and trans artists—paint different moods. Sometimes it's raw and sexy, other times meditative and strange, but always charged with attitude and passion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJackie House\nHNYPOT 300: Half A Bar Will Do It\n\nJackie House's \"Half A Bar Will Do It\" mix came out 11 months ago, in that post-New Year's, deep-winter stretch of time when dance music in the Northern Hemisphere briefly goes into hibernation. It matches that mood perfectly, easing, over the course of three hours, through soothing, low-energy grooves of all kinds, from Kompakt deep cuts to ambient jungle pitched way, way down. Jackie's photo—swaddled in blankets, bathed in warm lamplight—shows the best way to take this one in. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNosedrip\nLive: Dekmantel Festival 2019\n\nIt's one thing to play a bunch of psychedelic dub and obscure post-punk on the radio. It's something else entirely to mix it at a festival and hold the dance floor. That's what Nosedrip did on the Red Light Radio stage at Dekmantel this summer. Luckily, we now have the recording to pogo to. In the STROOM head's hands, a rare Belgian cut like Siglo XX's \"Individuality\" becomes a statement of purpose: \"I don't wanna be like the others / I am an originality / In search for individuality.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSybil Jason\nBlowing Up The Workshop 103 \n\nSybil Jason's Blowing Up The Workshop mix is only 40 minutes long and it ends abruptly after a particularly satisfying transition. Showcasing her range, this quick, intense and blindsiding mix ranges from weirdo downtempo to synth-pop to techno, as Jason jumps between eras like a skilled time traveler. She had a bigger year than ever in 2019, and it's DJing skills like this that got her there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpekki Webu\nNous'klaer Radio #20\n\nThough trance has been bubbling up again in dance music for a few years now, in 2019 it took centre-stage. While some turned to Eurodance for inspiration, Spekki Webu sought out the throb of the genre's earlier psychedelic forms. This precise set for Nous'klaer Audio is a masterclass in otherworldly DJing, journeying into hallucinogenic, hypnagogic soundscapes before it melts into the ether.",

There's a lot to say about \"Little Birds, Moonbath,\" the enchanting new age track by Yu Su, but that sound (an alert string chord struck at a very high, slightly off-key pitch) is its distinguishing feature. It might be usefully compared to a sharp nudge from a friend (\"Pay attention!\") in the presence of something worth seeing, or in this case hearing. Those sounds are Michelle Helene Mackenzie's lace-like modular synth, the bucolic cascades of melody, and Yu Su's poetic, deep-in-the-mix spoken word.

But for all the LP's weirdo impulses (it's introduced by a cyborg reading 1984) what stood out most in PTU's uniquely odd world was a cheeky, Cheshire Cat charisma. \n\nListen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

The LP gradually develops with swirls of organ, hums of string and quivering vocals, starting from nothing and growing into something intricate and complex. It's the most difficult, intense and rewarding album from an artist whose music rings loudest at its most quiet and tender.\n\nListen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

In today's professionalised dance music climate, wacky recluses like Raczynski come off like relics of authenticity.

The Chinese-born, Vancouver-based artist's mix references her classical piano training, the death of her mother and her love of Edward Yang films. In Yu Su's singular world, Liszt's impressionistic piano swells blend seamlessly into Terekke's deep dubs and the motorik optimism of Kraftwerk. The mixing and flow are remarkable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNathan Micay\nBIS Radio Show #946\n\nNathan Micay has long professed a love for trance and progressive house anthems, but few of his sets capture it as well as this radio session, which begins with the euphoric swell of Björk's \"Big Time Sensuality,\" weaves through Paul Oakenfold remixing Smashing Pumpkins and Grooverider reworking The Stone Roses, with newer day-glo productions holding things up in between. If you're dying for an alternate future where '90s excess never ended, this mix is for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkua\nDISCWOMAN 51\n\nAkua is one of many young techno artists who aren't afraid to notch up the tempo, and she's also one of the DJs who does it the best. Full of throttling kick drums, careening synths and thrillingly broken rhythms, Akua makes you feel like you're hurtling through the air at Mach 3. It's a fast and skilled mix worthy of the DJ heroes—Claude Young, Mike Dearborn—that she names in the accompanying interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCL\nHNYPOT 291: Ode To The Queer Steppas\n\nOn \"Ode To The Queer Steppas,\" their entry in Honey Soundsystem's excellent podcast series, CCL gives us tour through dubstep's strange outer reaches. Weaving together cuts from innovators like T++, Peverelist, Pinch and Shackleton, as well as newer bits from labels like SUED, the mix is balmy, psychedelic and utterly devoid of genre clichés. HNYPOT 291 exemplified that most difficult of DJ tricks: make a familiar style sound utterly different.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLSDXOXO\nFACT Mix 667\n\nLSDXOXO's journey from enterprising hip-hop producer to edit master to no-holds-barred DJ has been exciting to watch. This mix, jumping from old-school house and techno to Baltimore club to ghettotech to hardstyle and lots of subgenres in between, is no less of a rush. It's classic, it's new, it's queer and it's tough, and it's an example of the kind of flair that should help this New Yorker make waves in his new home of Berlin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvalon Emerson\nEssential Mix\n\nIt's not exactly surprising that Avalon Emerson's Essential Mix is good as it is, but you still have to marvel. The mixing is slick, dynamic and bold. The tracklist is full of private edits and upcoming music by talented friends (Aurora Halal, Nathan Micay, Overmono), as well as curveball bits of shoegaze and synth pop. As for that bit with the Soul II Soul acapella played at the wrong speed over a rumbling Paul Woolford track—was there a better moment in any mix this year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nre:ni\nXLR8R Podcast 557\n\nRecorded live at the debut edition of Orbits festival, you can almost feel the sweltering Portuguese heat emanating from re:ni's opening tracks. Everything is built from the same building blocks—precisely layered percussion, unconventional rhythms and airy pads—as the mix builds up from soft dub and trippy chuggers to psychedelic techno. It's a lesson in coaxing mid-afternoon revelers onto the dance floor. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeach\nDISCWOMAN 55\n\n\"I don't think I've been ever very good at the chill thing,\" Peach admitted when her Discwoman mix was published in October. No matter: her sets happily exist in a space well outside the chill zone. DISCWOMAN 55 was as bright as it was tough, with dreamy breakbeats, 135 BPM rave, the odd dollar-bin oldie and loads of great new music. This was Peach doing what she does best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRicardo Villalobos\nEssential Mix\n\nWhat constitutes a good Ricardo set is one of dance music's enduring questions. This one, recorded at Amnesia in Ibiza, has been decried in some quarters for being too commercial. There are some bigger-room tunes in here, not least the Girada Unlimited rework of \"Zapatac,\" but Ricardo's signature tightrope walk between hyper-precision and his famous no-fucks-given attitude is in full effect. And you know from those fader-flicks in the opening stretch that you're in for a treat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmar\nMOJ mixes 15\n\nThough currently based in Berlin, Omar comes from Uruguay, a scene where Nicolas Lutz looms large. No surprise then that he'd deliver such a stellar contribution to the podcast series of My Own Jupiter, a \"multidisciplinary art platform\" run by Lutz and Edurne.  A high-energy trip through charismatic techno, electro and house, Omar's mix moves through a range of sounds and moods, strung together with the slick transitions associated with Uruguay's homegrown selectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMumdance\nShared Meanings\n\nIf you're the type of person who delights in music that sounds like nothing that came before, Mumdance is your guy. Recorded as a free companion to the compilation he curated, this mix flirts with techno and drum & bass and swerves off the genre map altogether. Featuring tracks from Nkisi, Bambounou and Galaxian, Shared Meanings rounds up some of the most defiantly futuristic club tracks of the year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle Hall and Jay Daniel\nLive: Fundamentals @ Marble Bar Detroit\n\nDespite their international acclaim, Kyle Hall and Jay Daniel are doing it for Detroit. Case in point: their Fundamentals party, a no-frills back-to-back session that's gone down over six years at bars, coffee shops and lofts in the D. This live recording from Marble Bar is a masterclass exploring the intersection of Detroit house, the jazzy '90s Chicago sound, UK broken beat and a whole lot of soul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlikback\nUnsound Podcast\n\nSlikback's first gig outside East Africa took place in a Kraków basement on a chilly night at this year's Unsound festival. That performance saw the Kenyan artist play an hour of trap, grime and deconstructed club music—all his own music and remixes, including a tune he'd made earlier that day. It was one of the festival's highlights, announcing the arrival of yet another exciting Nyege Nyege talent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeatrice Dillon\nFACT Mix 657\n\nUnafraid of pauses, jitters or pivots in direction, Beatrice Dillon showcases her distinctive approach to DJing on this winding mix. She describes it as an hour of \"complete tracks and cut up fragments of work by so many different artists,\" with credit given only to artists and no track titles. Carefully arranging tracks like a jigsaw puzzle, it's the way they interlock and sit together that reveals a bigger picture as the mix unfolds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMx. Silkman\nBeyond / Below 10\n\nIn less than a year, Hi-Vis's Beyond / Below mix series has established itself as a go-to for ambient mixes, thanks to an open-ended approach that emphasizes both patience and personality. This mix from Cleveland's Mx. Silkman might be the best of them all. It's peaceful with a hint of tension, and underlined with a kosmische-inspired sense of melody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkee Mask and Zenker Brothers\nUnsound Podcast\n\nUnsound Festival is ostensibly a showcase for music's cutting edge, but it's also earned a reputation for being a superb place to cut loose. Exhibit A: this three-way back-to-back from Skee Mask and Zenker Brothers, recorded early one Sunday morning in Hotel Forum's main room. The range of styles reflects the Ilian Tape sound, but its rowdy energy draws from jungle—from the spinbacks to the volatile, seat-of-your-pants mixing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYaeji\nBlowing Up The Workshop 98\n\nThere are artists who stand out in their field, and there are artists who are their own field—like Yaeji. Not content to merely play 40 minutes of her favorite music, on Blowing Up The Workshop 98 she adds improvised vocals to create a kind of mix/mixtape hybrid. Yaeji hums, whispers, raps and sings over modern club tracks from the likes of Etch, Chevel and the late DJ Rashad, using her voice and effects to make stylistic jumps feel like natural transitions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeki Latex\nThe Naked King\n\nThis guy doesn't call himself the \"king of blends\" for nothing. The third and final instalment in the French artist's mix trilogy might be the most hilarious and impressive of them all. Squarepusher into Lil' Flip? Sure. Crime Mob's \"Knuck If You Buck\" over Swedish House Mafia? Why not. Eurythmics into Daft Punk into DJ Deeon? Naturally. Every moment of this mix is so turbo-charged with energy and humour, it's like a roller coaster ride you'll want to go on again and again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKampire\nSounds Of Sónar\n\nKampire set the tone for her standout set at this year's Sónar festival with this Sounds Of Sónar mix, released a couple of months before the main event in Barcelona. It was some calling card from the Kampala DJ, mixing up fresh sounds from Angola, Uganda, Nigeria and the DRC. Full of catchy pop hooks and booming bass, this one showed precisely why Kampire is one of East Africa's leading DJs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn T. Gast\nUVC Roots & Destruction\n\nJohn T. Gast's enigmatic druid dub creeps quietly out of London with little fanfare, but his fans are cult-like in their devotion to him. This year's instalment of the Roots And Destruction mix series for Bus Editions is more like a solo album than a mixtape, an extension of Gast's private universe that connects dub, knackered electronics and ambient, making heartbreaking paeans with MIDI instruments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMama Snake & Solid Blake\nLive: Dekmantel Festival 2018\n\nApeiron Crew cofounders Mama Snake and Solid Blake are formidable DJs in their own right, but this live recording from Dekmantel shows how phenomenal they are back-to-back. From the brooding electro to the Shepard tones of Ploy's \"Garys,\" through wild cuts of breakbeat, electro, techno and trance, the duo's 90-minute set at Dekmantel's UFO stage is a reminder of the kind of synergy that a back-to-back makes possible. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolet\nCrack Mix 214\n\nAs founder of the record label Naive, cofounder of Rádio Quântica and a string of local parties, Inês Coutinho is a galvanizing force in Lisbon's music scene. She's also a sick DJ, as small clubs and parties around the world are beginning to discover, and as her Crack mix makes clear. Elegantly swerving through one raucous banger after another, never playing the saying type of track twice, Crack 214 shows a gifted DJ having a blast with her records. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupsammy\nBAR Radio #40\n\nWhen she's not making bangers, Thessa Torsing, AKA upsammy, spends most of her time digging for bleepy curios. She's got a particular penchant for downtempo tracks in the 90 BPM range, a style she explores beautifully on BAR Radio #40. The mix is a slo-mo meander through golden ambient, IDM and other hard-to-define melodic jams. There's even a UK bass track played at the wrong speed. Together, they form one of the year's classiest and most adventurous mixes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nobject blue\nBandcloud Guest Mix\n\nThe Beijing-born, London-based artist object blue was a producer and live act before she was a DJ, and the way she mixes tracks has the arresting flair of a live performance. Her Bandcloud mix is a good example. Dizzyingly complex but intuitive, blending techno, breaks, experimental club and footwork, she bobs and weaves through angular, futuristic sounds with an ease that reflects her level of technique. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlo Dill\nSANPO 121\n\nThe aesthetic of Australia's Sanpo Disco mix series is leisurely—\"Sanpo\" is Japanese for \"stroll,\" the series being inspired by its founder's love of long walks. NTS regular Flo Dill got the memo, starting out with some glorious Pat Metheny on ECM, before spending an hour sharing the wistful music that soundtracks her bus commutes around London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDJ Healer\nPlanet Lonely\n\nIn May, a few weeks after his his double-album release on Easter Sunday, DJ Healer released a free mix through his Soundcloud page called Planet Lonely. Except it isn't really a mix. Moments of silence separate its dozens of tracks, which dip through ambient, downtempo and something like drum & bass, their mellowness offset by themes of self-destruction and apocalypse anxiety. Released as an album, Planet Lonely would have been among the year's biggest records. And yet this oddly understated format seems fitting, if only within the strange logic of this artist's word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDJ Senior Vasquez\nPARAISOMIX001\n\nYou probably know about the Detroit-Berlin connection, but how about the New York-Lisbon connection? New York master Junior Vasquez was a fan of the Portuguese tribal sound of the mid-'90s, and he often played tracks by Portuguese producers at the Sound Factory in Manhattan. DJs like Danny Tenaglia caught on too, and a musical bond formed between the two scenes. Lisbon's Photonz makes this sonic connection audible with this funky, smooth mix of Portuguese house from that era. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNazira\nMixmag - Kazakhstan scene\n\nThe proverbial electronic music map has expanded these last few years, with cities like Kiev, Tbilisi and Montevideo earning overdue recognition. Nazira's January mix for Mixmag turned our attention to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, and her hometown. Capturing the sound of Nazira's ZVUK parties, its big basslines, razor-sharp synths and precision rhythms offer a thrilling glimpse into this small but lively scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvan Baggs\nXLR8R Podcast 530\n\nIn the two years between Evan Baggs' RA Podcast and this mix for XLR8R, his focus on an acidic strain of vintage sci-fi techno has tightened. Baggs embodies excellence in this field, and the mix is a sort of mission statement for the vision he's built over the past three or four years alongside artists like Binh and DJ Masda. Without feeling remotely nostalgic, it's a history of dance music's forgotten corners that jolts the present with new energy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlive T\nTruancy Volume 205\n\nOn first glance, Olive T's Truancy mix feels like it's going to be a smooth ride through deep and melodic house. Then it starts to get more psychedelic, ratcheting up to a rude and heavy breakbeat section before settling back down again. That mid-section explores UK-inspired sounds, but there's something so American about the demeanor of the mix—its confidence, its soul—that reminds you why she's one of the country's up-and-coming DJs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a bonus, here are ten of our favourite RA mixes from the past 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDJ Bus Replacement Service\nRA Podcast 610\n\nDoris Woo's RA Podcast, which includes a recording of a North Korean newsreader, an ode to Donald Trump sung by preteens, and a song called \"'Roxanne' By The Police But Every Time They Say 'Roxanne' It Gets Faster,\" shows that her DJ-set-as-stand-up routine isn't just funny—it's downright innovative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSonido Confirmación\nAn Introduction To The Sonidero Sound\n\nThe loose and groovy sound of Mexico City's mobile soundsystem parties, mixed by one of scene's key sonideros. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOcto Octa\nRA Live: Sónar, Barcelona\n\nThe New York artist's jubilant live set from this year’s Sónar festival covers a wider variety of sounds and genres than we’ve heard in her music before. Slipping effortlessly through bouncy breakbeat, shimmering trance and heads-down techno, Octo Octa's music has never felt more vibrant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLilMofo\nRA Podcast 646\n\nRecorded at Grassroots, one of Tokyo's finest small venues, this full-throttle selection of techno and jungle won Lil Mofo plenty of new fans. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrson\nVersion: RA Label Of The Month\n\nVersion is known primarily as Germany's preeminent dubstep outpost, but Orson's mix for Label Of The Month shows the impressive scope of their vision. Fusing Version dubplates with old records from rave heroes like Joey Beltram, Frankie Bones and Lenny Dee, the mix exemplifies Orson's knack for time-travelling blends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSofay\nRA Live: Brilliant Corners\n\nFor our RA Live event at Brilliant Corners in March, Sofay travelled down from Glasgow with a bag full of evocative experimental records—perfect for a cosy night in the East London hi-fi bar. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjekt\nRA Podcast 650\n\nHaving successfully conquered tempo, TJ Hertz set his sights on techno's other main structural limitation: kick drums. RA.650 has none of them, and when it breaks through the clouds with Surgeon's all-time classic \"Radiance,\" you'll wonder if techno ever needed them at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJosey Rebelle\nLive: Rainbow Disco Club 2018\n\nClose your eyes and picture the scene: you're in a leafy valley with the sun on your back, and Josey Rebelle, one of the world's best DJs, is throwing down party slammers. Sounds pretty great, right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNightwave\nRA Podcast 638\n\n62 minutes of rowdy, acid-flecked, neon-tinted party rockers from one of Glasgow's finest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonato Dozzy\nLive: Alternate Cuts\n\nDonato Dozzy closed last year's Terraforma Festival with a set that bypassed his deep techno sound for half-time drum & bass and gabber. He tried this tempo-spanning, mind-bending approach at Manchester's Soup Kitchen, and the results were similarly spectacular.",

That it was made in 2018 by a 21-year-old is proof of upsammy's talent.",
