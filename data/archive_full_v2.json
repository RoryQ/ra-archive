Following her beloved\n        debut album, these 19 tracks are a remarkable crossover between R&B,\n        ambient and the kind of experimental music you might expect from\n        genre-adverse producers like Klein and DJ Haram. Soulful and sexy,\n        scornful and weird, the album charts an explosive period of emotional\n        growth.",

In tandem with some of\n        the UK's most in-demand MCs and vocalists—Flowdan, Skepta, Issey\n        Cross—Virji totally steps up, showcasing songwriting agility that\n        explains the current hype and glut of sold-out shows.",

The record is dense enough to wrap\n        around and colour an environment, but never too imposing. This\n        30th-anniversary reissue highlights the pioneering drone duo's staying\n        power. The smudged guitar flickers on \"Down\" gently speak to the current\n        moment. In the era of Spotify's anodyne functionality playlists, the\n        majesty of a slowly undulating drone piece like \"Goodnight\" feels like a\n        brilliantly comical riposte to the idea of easy-listening music. But\n        those subtle challenges have guided Stars of the Lid from the beginning.",

Take \"Critical,\" which consists of little more than\n        drums, a squelchy, two-chord Juno stab and hip-hop-coded vocals. It\n        feels like mainlining a double espresso.",

        "description": "Halfway through Nono Gigsta's sequel to her 2018 Freerotation set, also named The House of Crocodiles, we get an indication of the strange title's origins. \"The males' rippling flesh sends soundwaves through the water… humans can barely hear them, but the crocodiles can. Welcome to the House of Crocodiles,\" a sample narrates. And then, oh so naturally, it moves into a roaring electric guitar solo (Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lotta Love\"). It's a bonkers move that can prompt you to completely rethink what DJing can be. It's also completely natural in the hands of the Belgian DJ.Jaw-dropping transitions dominate this two-hour recording, aptly described as \"Big Blend Academy\" by one commenter. Low-end frequencies anchor the mix as it darts through wild variations in mood and tempo. Dubwise experiments (LUXE's \"Diamond Dub\") morph into frenetic jazz techno (Gigi FM's \"Gabriella\"), sounding like DJ Sprinkles if she dabbled in UK bass. You can feel Gigsta's sense of freedom as she aqueously glides across loose and liquid rhythms.Freewheeling mixes of this sort often risk being overly headsy, but this is a very fun listen that spans Björk, Foster Sylvers and Victoria Monet. The inclusion of more \"popular music\" only adds to the overwhelming sense of feverish delight. There's only one reasonable response to a mix this audacious: \"WTF.\" - Bella Aquilina",

Balearic downtempo, acid house, dubby disco and woozy krautrock criss-cross one another like whispery marble veins, transporting listeners to a sleek, '70s-style disco where our protagonist is getting her lounge on. There's a nonchalant swagger underlining every track, as if mirroring her breezy movements. The mood is loose-limbed but there's a high degree of intellect and intention behind each rhythm, just like a Bond girl's alluringly sharp demeanour. - Nyshka Chandran",

For FMB, the London-based artist condensed that two-and-a-half-hour set into this lean power-hour of soulful sub-pressure. Just listen to the way she moves from the soothing resplendence of Ella Fitzgerald to the dank 140 of Slimy, Delta and Obskure within the opening ten minutes.

If a snapshot could be taken of the styles that reigned 2024's dance floors, it's this: an incredibly cohesive and soft-hued marriage of nimble breakbeats, techno and trance from an artist going from strength to strength. - Chloe Lula",

His powers shine in this live recording from Portugal's Waking Life festival, which brims with otherworldly ambience.

Whereas the traditional stylings tend to be chirpier and whimsical, blippy effects, this strain, full of springy basslines and looped drums, takes budots off the streets and into the club. - Nyshka Chandran",

If it can't guarantee good fortune, it can at least transport a listener somewhere they feel lucky to be. And no song in 2024 made as great an escape as Nick León and Erika de Casier's \"Bikini.\"\"It leaks into the music somehow,\" León said earlier this month of growing up by the ocean. The Miami native describes his compositions as spaces to inhabit rather than stories; a personal stamp strong enough to transform any output he lends his hand to, be that ambient (Gloria) or perreo heaters (Rompediskoteka). De Casier wields similar scene-setting skills: she wrote one of 2023's stickiest earworms, New Jeans' \"Super Shy,\" without ever sacrificing her signature delicate style presented to perfection on 2019 breakout album, Essentials.An anthem like \"Bikini\" was always on the cards for the pair: their last collaboration, the Dionysian \"Ex-Girlfriend\" with SHYGIRL, nailed the body-first composition of Nelly Furtado and Timbaland's best work. Harp-like keyboard notes pierce the clip of a bassline, plunging into deep dembow as elegantly as four-on-the-floor. Embracing de Casier's crystalline mezzo-soprano, \"Bikini\" pushes sound into pure sensation: sand between toes and lips on goose-pimpled skin. When she was a teenager, \"going to the swimming pool was the worst thing I could imagine,\" she told Mixmag in 2021. A decade-plus later, \"Bikini\" comes alive in the shedding of those inhibitions: why hedge around the pool, when you could head straight for the sea?Despite \"Bikini\"'s deft movement between shifting rhythmic patterns, the track still manages to capture a profound sense of pause. Trying to make sense of the changing tides—\"Lookin' out there / Tryin' to find a meaning\"—de Casier only finds herself recentered \"with the wind in my hair, just breathing in the air.\" It's these atmospheric tendencies that take \"Bikini\" from the track of September to the track of the year. Before León and de Casier, artists from Otis Redding to Kelela have gazed \"out there,\" hoping to find some sort of solace in the meeting of water and sky. And in a year so rife with misery, there are plenty of reasons to be fearful for the future. But \"Bikini\" charts a different course—it's a three-minute appeal to just be. - Hattie Lindert",

        "description": "Surgeon and Regis have been creating industrial anthems as British Murder Boys for more than two decades. Individually, they're synonymous with taut, stripped back dance floor grooves that close a circle between musique concrète and steel-toed techno. But when they come together, their output is raw and unbridled, channelling the punk lineage of Coil, Suicide and Throbbing Gristle.Indeed, their debut LP, Active Agents and House Boys, is fundamentally live-sounding, its distorted kicks and walls of resonant feedback grinding like unoiled gears. Yet the music's embrace of funk and even melody — a new string to their bow—underlines the duo's conviction that serious music doesn't have to take itself so seriously. - Chloe Lula",

In fact, these bitesize jams slide down like a fresh cocktail—all zinger, no filler.Regal86's exquisite drum work, crafty sampling and smoky sound palette coat the vast Bandcamp dump in a marked soulfulness. Even more impressive, he's no one-trick pony: the Monterrey producer is just as adept slinging out dubby ambient techno (\"Deep Forest\") and slamming hip-hop (\"Quiero que sepan\") as euphoric hardcore (\"Fades\") and the hardgroove (\"Baby Phat Jacket\") he built his name on.

Avant-garde queen Björk and contemporary ensemble Kronos Quartet also impressively made the roster.These features hint at the direction Jlin, who has gone from inventive footwork producer to unruly experimental composer, has taken over the years. \"Eye Am\"'s jubilant hand drums find more common ground with traditional African drumming, whereas \"Summon\" creates tension with a torrent of piercing strings. Rest assured, though, one listen to the plinky keys and juddering rhythms on \"Grannie's Cherry Pie\" confirms that this is still music that will spring dancers and footworkers into action. - Kiana Mickles",

But it's the massive opener, \"Hell of a Ride,\" that keeps us coming back.

Three years later, the London-based harpist and modular synthesist returned with a second LP that dives deeper into restorative sounds.As its title implies, Endlessness feels like an infinite moment in time, suspended by languorous synth arpeggios and hushed sax runs. While some jazz fans prefer the dynamism of its predecessor, the beauty of Endlessness lies in its quietude. Sit back and soak up its ambrosial chords. - Nyshka Chandran",

Evocative and trance-inducing, In Full Effect has only solidified jungle's enduring versatility. - Emeka Okonkwo",

For the heads, it delivers his signature package of intricately layered sound design, dense percussion, and a wash of echo and reverb. But this time, the DJ devotees get their due as well. ISS010 marks a shift from Skee Mask’s breakbeat explorations to a more dance floor-focused sound, reflecting the heavily house and techno-infused energy of his current DJ sets. The seven-tracker blends syncopated rhythms with gorgeous melodies, weaving flashes of dubstep and ambient textures into rave-ready form. Grime-indebted beats on tracks like “The Bills” could as readily host an MC as send a Detroit loft party into overdrive, while “Double Standard” combines shimmering synths with propulsive drums, making it well suited for introspective home listening or peak-time club play. In a major year for Skee Mask, ISS010 was a record that engaged both body and soul. - Fahad Akinsanya",

It's a fitting introduction to the musician's most accessible album yet, which largely forgoes the murky timbres and synth abstraction of her earlier works.Instead, tracks such as \"Oídos,\" where Fratti's sweet soprano springs above whining trumpet, have spawned comparisons to the jazzy angst of singer-songwriters like Fiona Apple. Or take \"Descubrimos un suspiro,\" where her voice is raw and up close as strings rustle against warm horns. On Sentir Que No Sabes, Fratti takes the threads of her denser projects and weaves it into a richly textured, utterly enthralling tapestry. - Kiana Mickles",

Nídia is something of an outlier within the Príncipe universe, her singular brand of kuduro and batida positioned slightly outside of the label's core sound. As for Magaletti, the experimental percussionist appears to be driven by a burning desire to constantly break new rhythmic ground, with each of her collaborative projects more ambitious than the last.It's no surprise, then, that their debut joint project, Estradas, sounded like little else this year. The nine-track LP begins as a tense to and fro between two artists feeling each other out, but the moments in which they find a shared musical language are dizzying.

Yet it was her XL debut where she truly shot for the moon with a record informed by stargazing and Stephen Hawking as much as Hideo Kojima and Noisia. Li practically undergoes a full villain arc in 23 minutes, staging a shift from tones so crystalline you'd be forgiven for thinking they were beamed direct from the Pillars of Creation, to mottled drumfunk hissing and heaving under the weight of menace.

        "description": "Not waving, or drowning, but drifting. That's how 2024 felt for many of us: a serotonin crash made all the more raw by an increasingly cruel world. After years of clubland electrifying the masses with the shock of the new, we chose to lean the other way, prioritising cosy records that made you thankful for what you already have (a craving that, in alternative circles, drew people to the spectral-jukebox transmissions of Cindy Lee like moth to flame). Into this climate landed a masterclass in softer vibrations from Brian Leeds, who, as Huerco S. and Pendant, has already proved himself a master of suspended animation several times over. One Day both encapsulated the mood and cut through it like a beacon.Does it augur poorly for a culture built on progression to take a step back and recalibrate? Well, the past was priced in; Loidis is the ancient name for Leeds, after all. And though One Day was built around slippery micro rhythms and delayed dub stabs, Leeds hardly soapboxed for a return to subtlety. The strongest promo was essentially happenstance, after he termed the project \"dub mnml emo tech\" to wriggle out of anything too formal, but wound up perfectly articulating its playful vibe.Just as For Those Of You…'s truncated loops were a creative sleight-of-hand, One Day pulls off a sly trick throughout. Leeds mimics the lossy compression and audio degradation favoured by the clicks 'n cuts set, only this time using stem separation software and creative resampling that falls closer, he told us, to hypermodern genres. In doing so, he created a shapeshifting palette: all muzzled kicks, panned basslines bobbing through hyaline textures and indulgent codas tacked onto nine- or ten-minute tunes (\"Why Do,\" \"Love's Linneaments,\" \"Sugar Snot\") that you could have sworn flashed by in four. It scans as wrong at first blush, so you're compelled to run it back a dozen times—by which point, naturally, it sounds exceptional.One Day doesn't just revitalise styles that faded from favour; it glows with the patience of Shinchi Atobe and DJ Sprinkles, the frolic of Isolée and Dinky, the 3 AM soul-searching of Claro Intelecto and Paul St. Hilaire. Most obviously, the spirit of Alcachofa and Vocalcity feel hardcoded into its DNA. These are records that have meant a lot to people over the years, made by artists who have stood the test of time. I'd be lying if I didn't think Leeds is in that conversation now.When it arrived, One Day might have seemed too discrete to break out, but months of compulsive listening have upended that. If we're resting at a waystation en route to a destination as-yet-unclear, there was no more generous or agreeable companion. So while there aren't many conclusions to be drawn from the discomforting haze of 2024, this much is true: the album that felt primed to take a slow stroll to classic status has raced way ahead of schedule. It's already there. - Gabriel Szatan",

        "description": "Warp RecordsKelela - Raven\nAt the shows for her new album, Kelela stood alone onstage. This was a deliberate choice, she explained, to have everything stripped back so audiences could see her—and hear her—for all she was. But up there, the blue lights around her dimmed, it was clear that her solitary figure also reflected her more bitter-than-sweet struggles against what she described as \"male stoicism.\" This remark came from the revelations she had while reading The Will to Change, an investigation of men, masculinity and love by the radical Black feminist scholar bell hooks. Her epiphany was painstakingly reflected in the dancehall derivation \"On The Run\": \"You get around enough / Too busy actin' tough / Give me a softer side / I won't wait all night.\" Patriarchal culture doesn't only hurt women, Kelela discovered—it also restricts the way men are able to explore intimacy and achieve wholeness for themselves.\n\nI saw Kelela perform in Berlin. 13 of Raven's 15 tracks were produced there, and it shows. There's a sorrow and solemnity woven into the city's monochromatic corners that echo through Raven, like a pebble rattling in an empty aluminium can. Even the title track is underpinned by a spacious yearning, as if on the brink of a breaking point—\"Took all my labour / Don't tell me that I'm strong,\" she sings, before gradually trotting into a heaving 4/4 beat, a subtle nod to clubbing as escapism. By the album's conclusion, \"Far Away,\" Kelela finds her deliverance in the form of honeyed ad-libs undulating over sounds of crashing waves, as if signalling that with enough time and perspective, all pain can be alchemised into pure spirit. -Whitney Wei",

Through visceral lyrics that underline the idea of desire as a truly physical sensation, the ex-Chairlift vocalist sings of self-indulgent surrender to a lover without the slightest care of appearing desperate or needy. But it's the production—from Polachek and Danny L. Harle—that truly makes this a multifaceted pop record: feathery drum & bass, flamenco, dreamy rock and bassy R&B bops add to the physicality of Polachek's feelings, pushing her theatrical vocals outside of the shielded realm of inner thoughts and into the material world. -Nyshka Chandran\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

        "description": "Border CommunityJames Holden - Imagine This Is A High Dimensional Space Of All Possibilities\nJames Holden's music has always been otherworldly. Raised on pirate radio, folktronica, free jazz and everything in between, he conjures up mythical fairy tales where flickers of dance music past meander into pastoral soundscapes. This all culminated with Imagine This Is A High Dimensional Space Of All Possibilities, which marks a welcome return to the club for Holden—or his version of it, anyway. Recognisable dance music tropes (hints of dub techno, echoes of house, microdoses of rave) nestle into the rich and complex instrumentation that gives all of Holden's music its distinctive flair. If Jon Hassell had been born four decades later and became hooked on acid house, this is the album he would've wanted to write. -Henry Ivry\n\nListen:\nBandcamp",

        "description": "DominoTirzah - trip9love...?\nOver the past decade, childhood friends Tirzah Maston and Mica Levi have become a quietly formidable power duo (in leftfield music circles, at least). On their latest LP of heart-tugging R&B, Levi's tough 808s and trilling piano sketches hold a steady, unrelenting pace while Tirzah pours her heart into 11 rough-and-ready love songs. All the familiar hallmarks of Tirzah are there—understated vocals and a sound rooted in \"disarming simplicity\"—but here everything is notched up to a new, more physical intensity. Each track packs a smouldering punch and Levi's distorted piano melodies on tracks like \"F22\" and \"Promises\" have Grand Cru earworm qualities. The album turns Tirzah and Levi's often ramshackle songs into a steamrolling train that tugs at the heartstrings all the harder, while still holding onto the lightweight feel that makes all of the project's music so enchanting. -Conor McTernan\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

Regal86, a buzzy producer from Monterrey makes all kinds of music, but he's particularly good at hardgroove. His album La Onda landed at the perfect time to take the revival to the next level. With breathless sequencing and expert programming, this is hard, fast dance music that doesn't bludgeon you over the head, but instead invites you to dance and get lost in its intricacies. And with trip-hop breaks and clever interludes, La Onda works as an album through and through, recalling some '90s techno greats with real finesse. -Andrew Ryce\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

On Playing Robots Into Heaven, he dives head first into club music and delivers some of his canniest fusions yet. The melodrama and introspection is still there, but on tracks like the thrilling \"Loading\" or the surging house of \"Fall Back,\" his words—and dextrous vocal chopping—gains a whole new power, especially when sandwiched between woozy ballads like \"Fire The Editor.\" In other words, it's the best of both worlds. -Andrew Ryce\n\nApple Music / Spotify",

Over 14 tracks, the funky tech house he built his name on makes room for plaintive New Age delights and darkly tinted downtempo. It's a turbulent, subaquatic voyage that reaches even murkier depths than 2021's The Forced Force Is Not The True Force. Where the sonar-guided ominousness and broad sawtooth basslines on tracks like \"No Safe Zones\" evoke the ocean floor, the searching keys and trance-inducing hand drums on tracks like \"For Those Who Have Lost\" still reach for the cosmos.

Her debut album yawns to life with loose breakbeats over a lattice of whispery vocals, and eventually spins out into another realm of glimmering downtempo music. A special kind of self-assured ease in drifting into the unknown exists here.

The LP fuses Berlin school Krautrock and fourth world ambient with the odd bit of Detroit electro and techno, both unexpected and unbelievably impressive.

And then she was kind of stuck with it, until it became her defining instrument of the decade so far. On Atlas, her first so-called ambient album, she takes her piano and the sounds of collaborators on strings and explodes it into sonic dust. Those particles are rearranged into gentle compositions that inhale and exhale like a living respiratory system, with melodies that appear like clouds on the horizon before rolling away and letting the music clear up again. Atlas takes the fearless compositional framework of past albums and her ear for slight-but-dazzling melodies and presents them in a new, almost neoclassical way.

The slow-burning LP unravels like a gentle love letter, pairing intuitive, staccato drums with conversational vocals and lush instrumentation (guitar and woodwinds). There are hints of jazz, trap and dub techno—perhaps a reference to batida's own cross-pollination from various Angolan and Portuguese styles—and a thread of tenderness and toughness.

Madres deftly combines house music with field recordings from indigenous communities, the Peruvian cajón drum, clips from a protest against homophobia and pan-Latin American rhythms.

Now, in 2022, he's charted again.\n\nLike DJ-Kicks, fabric presents Leon Vynehall is all about dynamics, except this time the focus is on the club. You'd think that might be restrictive, but Vynehall is a master at finding common threads and energies in disparate musical worlds. Here, work by Mala, A2, Or:la, Ehua, Lady Blacktronika, Commodo, Hagan, Skee Mask and textures from so many other producers hang together in a smoky, soulful soup. The stitching is sublime, the music consistently excellent. At points, it's enough to take your breath away. —Carlos Hawthorn",

He tours all the time, but still finds time to write a regular newsletter about everything going on around him. As a DJ he exudes enthusiasm, playing groovy records that run the gamut from sleek contemporary tech house to old school Italo classics. This live recording from Dimensions captures his range perfectly: he starts low and slow, but just as things get a bit heady, he makes a U-turn with the outrageous vocal track \"Adventure\" by Eleanor and Shep Pettibone. From there, things dart between the cerebral and the cheesy. Vintage hip house gives way to G-funk-laced electro and acid before dissipating into celestial techno and old school rave. It's hard to imagine that even the security team wasn't losing it during this masterclass in Tisno. —Henry Ivy",

His HÖR Berlin mix from January this year perfectly encapsulates this style. Minimal yet replete with understated hooks, it layers psychedelic flurries of toms with tribal drums, house vocals and trancey melodic fills.

The Miami producer is at the forefront of a new wave of 305-area artists who fuse together the city's unique tapestry of Hispanic cultures—and its deep connections to Latin America—with its robust dance music history. León specifically mixes influences from reggaeton and perreo into what is sometimes termed \"Latin tribal techno,\" but whatever you want to call it, there's no denying the appeal of \"Xtasis,\" the track most of us heard out on dance floors more than any other, by a country mile.\n \n\"Xtasis,\" a collaboration with Venezuelan raptor house pioneer DJ Babatr, is a good example of the intercontinental cross-pollination happening within this scene. The percussion plays a trick, both four-on-the-floor and broken at the same time, at a chemically-enhanced pace with distant vocal wails that add a lysergic flair. But \"Xtasis\"—and its accompanying Pearson Sound and Doctor Jeep remixes—really clicks with the old-school organ bassline that drops in at about the two-minute mark. It's something so simple, so familiar and, frankly, genius, that by the time the kick drum drops back in, the room should be in a frenzy.

Simple but effective, Dygas approaches these elements with a surgeon's precision as she moves them up and down in the mix. This was Dygas's first 12-inch in over half a decade, a welcome return of one of minimal's weirdos-in-chief. \"Butterfly Effect\" is a reminder of the strange sense of wonder that only the best minimal can create, where it feels like a loop could go on forever. —H.I. \n \nListen:\nSoundcloud",

Starting with the flicker of an acid line, \"Somewhere Near Marseilles\" unfolds over 11 minutes of exquisitely produced house, bobbing and glimmering in all the right places. Hikaru sings what feels like three different choruses in a mixture of English and Japanese, glamourously exhorting their lover to meet them in Marseilles as an in-between point between London and Paris. \"Let's go fast, then go slow,\" they repeat over the constantly morphing instrumental track. It's a snippet of luxury and contentment that feels as lush as the song sounds, only improved by Hikaru's impeccable vocal performance—the way she sings, \"I'm in London / You're in Paris\" is both commanding and effortlessly cool. It's rare that the pleasures of pop and house music come together this well, a cosmopolitan adult contemporary jam made for the most amourous hours of the night. —A.R. \n \nListen:\nApple Music / Spotify",

The summer streets come alive with reggae and hip-hop; house music wafts in through FM radio or from the cracked window of your longtime neighbour. The vital life force and diversity of the city's sounds has coloured Kush Jones's discography over the years. He typically releases music—drawing from house, jungle, footwork and hip-hop—independently at a fast clip. One of his many works from this year was 6 Days, an EP that was written in, you guessed it, six days. Within a record that shifts rapidly between house and juke, the highlight comes from the pensive pads, idle, honey-sweet melody and subtle percussion on opener \"BX Bounce,\" embodying the very best of New York's intangible cultural heritage. —K.M. \n \nListen:\nBandcamp",

The revival of genres like jungle and trance, among others, is proof positive, and the subject of many articles from cultural critics like Simon Reynolds and Mark Fisher. But there's a distinction to be made here. Some artists' chase of rose-tinted nostalgia is nothing more than empty cliché, while others treat their return to a bygone era like a hero's journey—familiar, yet eclipsed by a new, fortified sensibility.\n\nD. Tiffany and Roza Terenzi achieve the ideal balance on their debut album, Edge Of Innocence. It offers a mélange of influences that run the hi-BPM gamut from electro to drum & bass without losing grip of the rippling, psychedelic groove at the core of everything this duo do. \"Grains Of Sand\" is a case in point, replete with synths that stab through a thicket of lumbering percussion, as is the fittingly named breakbeat bop \"Redemption Arc,\" kitted out with all the sleek dynamism that emerges after a period of dark contemplation. By the end of Edge Of Innocence, you get the feeling that, though the duo are working with well-worn sounds, they've made them all their own. -Whitney Wei\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

On Fossora, Björk sings with a sweeping gravitas over rich woodwinds and distorted gabber beats, the additional instrumentation dancing around her vocal as she muses on the circle of life, nature and her own late mother. Digging her fingers into the earth, Björk unknots tributaries of tangled roots, the crashing drum patterns and complex textures representing the stark, breathtaking topography of her homeland. -Katie Thomas\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

Written to accompany an experimental video game about Scotland leaving the union, Escapology operates along a dual axis, at once anxious—filled with eerie bits of sci-fi chatter and dense layers of swelling feedback—but also hopeful, at least when he turns to club tracks. \"Uncoil,\" for example, is a pearl half-covered in sand somewhere between drum & bass and footwork, while \"Cross The Gap\" uses the negative space of dub to create something glimmering in the weight of the darkness around it. -Henry Ivy\n\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

There's palpable catharsis written into the energetic pulse of the album, which bleeds several genres into a satisfyingly cohesive mix that makes it difficult to discern where one song ends and another begins. Ambient sequences with knotty sections that twinkle and flutter turn into spaced out dub and then, somewhere along the way, listeners are transported to post-punk-leaning IDM.

The album is brighter than anything we'd heard from twigs before. Gone is the operatic austerity of MAGDALENE. Instead, Caprisongs  is a pop album with a capital P. The album mines from Afrobeats, grime, baile funk and R&B. It also sources from her personal life via snippets of conversations she recorded with loved ones. The immersive world she creates here deals with insecurity, \"stupid boys\" and friendship, but it's also celebratory. The world had opened up, after all. Twigs might have had a cry now and then, but at least she was doing it on the dance floor in the album's first single, \"Tears In The Club.\". As phenomenal as Caprisongs is, it's somehow even more impressive because it was pulled off with a welcome sense of humour. The album title, for example, is inspired by astrology—her \"stubborn Caprisun ass telling her to work through the pain.\" Listeners can even eavesdrop on an astrological reading by the album's close.

Many DJs claim to play across genres, but there are \"many DJs\" and then there is Theo Parrish. Over the past few years, the historically private artist has given fans a near-unprecedented view into his creative mind, first with the lengthy and unclassifiable sonic essay-meets-radio drama We Are All Georgeous Monsterss, and then this year with a six-and-a-half hour mix for NTS called \"Eargoggles.\" (Parrish also dropped another six-hour mix close to press time.) \n\nEargoggles is a marathon celebration of the infinite diversity of Black music, spanning from hard bop to hip-hop, searing psych rock to roots reggae. No random grab bag, this is a grand narrative and the revelation of a modern canon of soul with appearances by James Brown, The Congos and D'Angelo. The mix is an education unto itself—around hour five Parrish drops \"Jazz Cats Part 1,\" a cut consisting of Madlib breathlessly laying out his key jazz influences—yet it's also a generous statement of purpose bursting with joy and urgency.\n\n25 years into his career, Parrish gives us an exhaustive guide to the music that makes him tick, that has informed his own enduring classics. But why now? He explains the gravity of his convictions in the final moment of the magisterial \"Eargoggles\" mix:\n\nI'm hoping that at some point during this... After you've had a ride, a musical ride with me, that you take a moment to consider the troubles that you have, and consider that you're lucky to have them.\n\nEven if it doesn't affect you demographically, you should seriously consider the fact that there's an urgency that should be lived, in respect for those that get taken from us early under the guise of 'serve and protect.'\n\nSo let's survive together. But let's remember them together as well. Let's not forget how we treat each other when the music's playing and how things change when the lights go on and we all go back to the rest of our lives.\n\nLet's go back with a little more urgency and care for the fellow man. Let's give a damn a little bit. And if we can do that, we got a better place.—Matt McDermott",

We start in medias res with UK garage basslines, but his masterful pacing and mixing means that before we know it, we're zipping through starry rave, acidic electro, '90s house and just about everything else under the sun. For us mortal trainspotters, the only thing worse than having missed this party is that we'll likely never know what any of these records are.—H.I.",

Each new release of theirs seemed to outdo the last, from the euphoric rave of \"Pieces Of 8\" to their pitch-perfect fabric mix to the peppy garage of \"Diamond Cut\" (one of the major highlights from what was arguably the year's best Essential Mix). But it was \"So U Kno,\" released not on the duo's usual home of XL Recordings but on their own, smaller Poly Kicks imprint, that made it into what felt like every DJ set of the post-reopening world.\n\nLike so much of Overmono's recent work, there's a whiff of a bygone, post-dubstep era to \"So U Know.\" Built around an unforgettable vocal chop, \"So U Kno\" is the kind of track that elicits cheers from a dance floor the minute the DJ starts to mix it in. It has one of those in-between beats—kind of house, kind of 2-step, kind of techno—and a thrill-ride of a breakdown. Encapsulating the frenzied, overjoyed vibe of the summer's post-reopening clubbing with a hint of wistful nostalgia, \"So U Kno\" perfectly sums up this year's excitement and radical ups and downs.—Andrew Ryce\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

On their sophomore album, producers Joshua Inyang and Joshua Reid created a series of nocturnal meditations, a series of nineteen short tracks bleeding into one another, in tribute to their hometown of Manchester. The duo's instrumentation is replete with field recordings of urban white noise, balanced by resonant cellos, hazy guitars and spectral guest performances with fragments of profound conversations—as if overheard from the night before—resulting in the audio equivalent of subconscious dreamscape. \n\nPut simply by Inyang and Reid themselves, Honest Labour is \"an album about love and loss.\" The track \"Indigo Grit,\" for instance, abruptly ends just as the speaker is about to explain the difference between liking and loving someone—a fleeting snippet of wisdom lost just before listeners could grab hold of it. But as with any inquiries into life’s most existential questions, the artists weren't intending to arrive at any conclusions.

HTRK, the Australian duo comprising Jonnine Standish and Nigel Yang, are one of a handful of groups that inspire this level of dedication in their fans. Their music holds similar qualities to other classic \"favourite bands,\" like The Cure—their songs microcosms of ineffable longing and desolation. On their latest LP Rhinestones, HTRK continue to embrace stripped-down guitars, this time going for a twang and effects palette that evokes the Kodachrome skies of Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas. In the film, the sprawling vistas and stark photography set the stage for a hushed, heartbreaking drama. Here, the sparse guitar and unhurried progressions serve a similar purpose, foregrounding Standish's languid vocals.  As usual, deceptively simple lines like\"If you wanted to / Hang out with mе during the day,\" on \"Sunlight Feels Like Bee Stings,\" hit like a brick. —M.M.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

In his place sits a producer whose music is, with every new release, a truer, more vivid expression of not only his ever-broader tastes, but also his life and loves. Building on recent experiments with R&B and downtempo music, still slipping vol. 1 incorporates voice notes from his family—asking Joy how he's doing, making jokes, talking about weed brownies—into a cosy world of tunes that range from sedate garage to hooky, subdued pop. It feels like a Sunday afternoon in Joy's living room: vinyl all over the floor, loved ones popping in and out and talented friends occasionally jumping on the mic, all culminating into a more relaxed look at one of UK dance music's most quietly virtuosic producers.—Carlos Hawthorn\n\nListen:\n\nBandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music",

Mr. Mitch said this personal change occurred around the release of his 2017 album, Devout, a vulnerable record inspired by fatherhood. Not coincidentally, it was also the first time his fans had truly embraced his experimentations with slower tempos, ornate instrumentation and song-oriented structures. The Londoner built on this newfound freedom and confidence on this year's Lazy, with 11 tracks packing a range of energies and emotions. There are heart-rending tributes to his own musician father and strong statements about racism and social justice (the title is a reference to stereotypes about Black people), blending not only genres but personal and political messages in a way that could have felt forced and overblown in less accomplished hands.

Turns out, their styles complement each other. \"Straight Murder (Giggs & David),\" their second collaboration, showed both rappers at the top of their games, Dave relentless and razor-sharp, Giggs somehow both jovial and vicious. The wordplay is mind-blowing. And let's give a special shout-out to KeyzMusic, the man behind one of the best and most chilling beats of 2020.\n\nListen: Apple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020Track of the year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia Jordan\nFor You \nLocal Action\n\n\n\nIndia Jordan wrote For You to document the process of coming to terms with their queer identity. Taking cues from happy hardcore, drum & bass and house, the record opens with blissful house tracks \"I'm Waiting (Just 4 U)\" and the title track, recalling the late-night euphoria of last year's DNT STP MY LV. The \"you\" here refers to Jordan, who has recently come out to the public as non-binary.\n\nThere's a feeling of triumph that emanates from \"For You.\" The track shows Jordan's knack for chopping and looping vocal samples, this one employing the amorous hook of Change's \"You Are My Melody.\" The loop never gets old, and as satisfying as the final climactic breakdown of the track is, when the familiar hook comes back around, it makes you wonder why it left in the first place. But the vocals aren't all that make the track pop. \"For You\" is swaddled in an addictive sunny feeling, thanks to funky guitar riffs, seesawing '80s synths and rousing percussion. The track captures the dizzying joy of finding true love—in this case, the love of one's self. \n\n\nListen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif(window && !!window.LazyLoad){new window.LazyLoad({elements_selector:\".lazy\"});}",

        "description": "Kelela & Asmara\nAquaphoria\n\nOriginally aired as part of Warp's NTS takeover, Kelela and Asmara's Warp mixtape feels like a jam session between friends. Asmara sculpts an undulating backing track out of music from Aphex Twin, Suzanne Kraft & Jonny Nash and Kareem Lotfy—artists that have helped define the recent era of ambient music. Kelela's airy, improvised vocals act are the perfect counterpart to Jaco Pastorius' genius bass solo and Iury Lech's emotional washes. They bring this floating, beatless music to an unforgettable climax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLena Willikens & Vladimir Ivkovic\nLive: Nuits Sonores 2019\n\nHeadlining festival sets don't always work outside the original setting—as with well-timed jokes, you kinda had to be there. But leave it to Lena Willikens and Vladimir Ivkovic to make their three-hour Nuits Sonores odyssey suit nearly any context. It's meditative, weird and, lest we forget the main room dance floor it soundtracked, banging. Filled with the pair's characteristic slower selections, this mix feels like swimming inside a crystal ball. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCL\nUnsound Podcast 56\n\nCCL called this mix a \"regurgitated memory\" of their Honcho Campout set, reflecting on the \"more twisted hours… before the light had come up.\" That predawn unpredictability is what's so exciting here. One highlight is their adept pulling back with Codek's \"Closer\" before diving into a Metalheadz Wax Doctor rush. With these unreal transitions, and touches like the experimental Polish music that bookends the mix (a nod to Unsound) CCL shows the careful craft that sets them apart. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruly Madly\nGHOSTCAST 006\n\nGhostcast, a mix series from Berlin's favourite record store on wheels, has only released a few recordings since launching two years ago, but each is a window into a world of deep-digging DJs with exquisite house and techno collections. Truly Madly is one of them. An underground favourite who's steadily gaining recognition outside the world of trainspotters and Discogs geeks, the Londoner's set traverses classic techno, electro and house, cloaked with the same spacey charm that colours his club sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoards Of Canada\nSocietas x Tape (NTS x Warp 30)\n\nBoards Of Canada are two of the most reclusive artists in electronic music, which means we don't know much about what they listen to during long stays in the Scottish countryside. Their Societas x Tape mix, a two-hour set broadcast on NTS as part of Warp's 30th anniversary, gives us an idea. Obscure electronics by Filmmaker, '80s post-punk by Killing Joke and synth-pop from Severed Heads tell us a little bit more about these pioneers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDee Diggs\nFACT Mix 710\n\nNew York's Dee Diggs is on a quest to remind everyone that dance music is black music. Her FACT mix is her fiery mission statement, cutting through the history of black dance music, from Paris Is Burning and vintage acts like DJ Deeon and Karizma to NYC's new guard, including upstarts like Devoye and AceMo. This mix is classic, soulful and banging in all the right places, securing Diggs' own place in the canon she's charting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEris Drew\nRaving Disco Breaks Vol. 1\n\nOn this year's funkiest mixtape, Eris Drew made some of dance music's most classic sounds her own. Raving Disco Breaks is composed of dance classics chopped into breaks on-the-fly by the American DJ, showcasing not only her impressive technical skills but also the emotional, spiritual and often nostalgic flair that makes her sets so electrifying. It's old-school technique with a new-school vibe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancesco Del Garda\nRobert Johnson Archive 0002\n\nFrancesco Del Garda played this set at Robert Johnson on the banks of the Rhine a few days after Christmas last year. He couldn't have asked for a better setting: sun rising, perfect soundsystem, six-hour time slot, festive crowd. This recording, an edition of the Frankfurt club's new mix series, gives us only an hour of it, but it shows Del Garda on fire, indulging the uplifting sound that distinguishes him from his contemporaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatu\nTruancy Volume 240\n\nBatu describes his Truancy mix as the closing set for a \"festival in 2030 called Bristol-Bass.\" Given his Timedance label and his own inventive productions, he's in a good position to imagine the future of UK dance music. The mix’s backbone wiggles and booms with modern bass music, while making adventurous jumps from Latin and Afro-Caribbean rhythms to ambient techno and experimental club.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErika\nIT.podcast.s08e01\n\nErika's Interdimensional Transmissions podcast from March really lives up to the Detroit label's name: it sounds like you're hearing an actual transmission from another dimension. IT does down-the-rabbithole techno better than anyone, and this recording of Erika at an LA showcase for sister label Eye Teeth shows the sound at its cosmic, funky, head-spinning best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDJ Persuasion\nDedicated To The Dedicated 94-95\n\nAsk any junglist worth their salt: 1994 and '95 were the golden years. Disagree? Well, you might feel differently after listening to Dedicated To The Dedicated 94-95, the latest hour-long mix by '90s dance music fanatic DJ Persuasion, AKA Semtek. Every tune, most of them near-impossible to track down, writhes with rhythm and soul. The warm basslines and time-stretched vocals spark tingles of euphoria. When people say the '90s were better, this is the kind of thing they're thinking of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSherelle\nLDN: Bass & Percs Special\n\nEarlier this year, Sherelle's debut Boiler Room session—a whirlwind of footwork, jungle and grime—went viral. While it's easy for some high BPM DJs to tire out their audience, her set maintains an addictive high energy throughout, with explosive, playful transitions that sparked the dance music equivalent of a mosh pit. Wait for the gutsy rewind at 23:40 that shot her to instant (and deserved) fame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeif\nFreerotation 2019\n\nLeif is part of a small group of DJs whose yearly sets at Freerotation festival in Wales always feel like a big deal. 2019 was no exception. In this recording, Leif redefines the peak-time set, starting slow and spindly before moving gracefully through many shades of cosy, rhythmic club music. There are tunes by Equiknoxx and Domu, Efdemin and Aphex Twin, all stitched together with extraordinary skill. As one SoundCloud commenter put it: \"are you even human.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Rubinstein\nPhonica Mix Series 56\n\nDr. Rubinstein is like an acid historian, wading through decades of dance music history to find the best 303 lines ever put to wax. Yet she still finds time in her Phonica mix to highlight several up-and-coming talents (Jack Roland, Gian) alongside more familiar names (DMX Krew, Adapta). Sometimes dark, sometimes bright, Phonica Mix Series 56 was a deeply psychedelic trip, weaving excellent electro and techno between forgotten acid bombs. As always with Rubinstein, the mixing was world-class, each transition bringing us further into her unique sound world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeon Vynehall\nDJ-Kicks\n\nLast year, Leon Vynehall released Nothing Is Still, showing the world that his production chops extended way beyond the club. In 2019 he did something similar, but with DJing. His proof this time is a spellbinding DJ-Kicks mix, which blends genres, eras and moods together with sublime flow and dexterity. Dancehall, techno, pop, jungle, soul, a solo piano piece—what could've been a hot mess ends up as one of the classiest mix CDs in recent memory. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nre:ni\nDekmantel Podcast 253\n\nre:ni's Dekmantel podcast does everything right. The tracklist left the sleuths at mixesdb mostly stumped. The mixing is inspired, moving swiftly through tempos and styles with quick sleights of hand and extended blends. More than anything, though, its re:ni's ineffable sense of groove—slinky, fluid, always in flux—that makes this one really pop off. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurtle Bugg\nHNYPOT 330: African Art of Acid (Triple A Baybee) Mixx\n\nTurtle Bugg's Honey Soundsystem mix makes a point so simple it often goes unsaid: black people invented acid house. And yet, as he puts it, \"There was no Second Summer Of Love in Amerikkka, no Ibiza for Negroes to spend their holiday, no beginnings of a multi-million dollar industry that could change the lives of Lady Liberty's bastard children.\" The voices of Dave Chappelle, Malcolm X and Derrick May ring out over interlocking acid lines. The message is clear: black ingenuity thrives, no matter who is paying attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen UFO\nHessle Audio - 9th September 2019\n\nWhat makes this Hessle Audio show, one of many hosted by Ben UFO in 2019, so special? Well, it just is. On that early autumn night, armed with a stack of fresh wax, the UK DJ was on particularly impressive form, treating regulars and first-timer listeners to a beautifully woven tapestry of ambient, Afro techno, jungle and Joe. When it aired, it wasn't just nerds and ravers listening, either—Four Tet, Hunee, John Talabot and other dance music dons had all tuned in for their weekly dose of musical inspiration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVia App\nCrack Mix 307\n\nVia App taps into the elemental energy of Brooklyn's techno underground on this mix for Crack, a set as volatile as any of their recent productions. This bumpy ride through jarring turns and interruptions, with its snarling, punkish spirit, hit harder than most other mixes we heard this year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/reviews/23502\">Powder In Space by Powder</a>\n\n\n\n\nPowder\nPowder In Space\n\nYou play Powder In Space once. You think, \"This is nice.\" You leave it for a while, then play it a second and third time. You notice things like the Roy Brooks vocal, or Daphne's bubbling vibraphone melody, that you didn't catch the first time. You also realize you've fallen in love with it. This is how Powder's mix gets under your skin: her unobtrusive approach, drawn from offbeat house with gorgeous textures, waits for you to come around to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShannen SP\nDISCWOMAN 80\n\nAlongside Kode9, Shannen SP runs Hyperdub's Ø events at London's Corsica Studios, a wonderful monthly midweek showcase of experimental music and art. She's quickly become a DJ to watch, and this mix for Discwoman showcases her knack for linking together sharp, angular beats with loose percussive rhythms—a style she sums up as \"witchy black energy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCiel\nFACT Mix 724\n\nCindy Li's FACT mix has a specific concept: \"fast & light,\" inspired by hummingbirds. It also captures what makes her DJing so dynamic. The Toronto artist makes breakbeat, electro and techno float like feathers on the breeze, moving through quick-footed drum patterns and fluttering melodies with finesse. Her technique changes the feel of the music itself, which is among the highest compliments you can pay a DJ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Therapy\nLive: Honcho Campout 2019\n\nThe Way In may have had the freakiest sounds at this year's Honcho Campout. Hours before CCL brought the dance floor to tears with Beat Happening, Physical Therapy unfurled this masterclass in trippy eclecticism. Cuts of perfectly dreamy drum & bass, a slo-mo version of Cece Peniston's \"Finally\" layered over Stenny’s \"Stress Test,\" Andrew Weatherall's remix of St Etienne, D'Angelo's \"Devil's Pie\"—the highlights in this one are simply too many to name. From a punter's perspective, hearing a DJ with such unique style going for it like this is basically as good as it gets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJosey Rebelle\nEssential Mix\n\n\"The thread that runs through the music I play, and my whole life, comes from my parent's generation,\" Josey Rebelle told us in 2017's Real Scenes: London film. Her parents are part of the Windrush generation, which arrived in the UK from the Caribbean in the 1950s and went on to make an inestimable impact on British life and culture. Rebelle's heritage pours out the speakers every time she's behind the decks. She's a quintessential London DJ: informed by the city's record shop and soundsystem culture, she's comfortable weaving together soul, techno, house, disco, R&B and jungle. Her first Essential Mix was dark and funky, with deep US music from Jamal Moss and Aybee featuring alongside London favourites Steven Julien and Cooly G.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAriel Zetina\nTruancy Volume 249\n\n\"Power to them sexy transsexuals out there, transforming the world,\" a woman intones in the opening moments of Ariel Zetina’s Truancy mix. It's one of many vivid vocal samples that contribute to the smartbar resident's sense of narrative. Beneath them, trippy acid house and soulful techno—much of it produced by other queer and trans artists—paint different moods. Sometimes it's raw and sexy, other times meditative and strange, but always charged with attitude and passion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJackie House\nHNYPOT 300: Half A Bar Will Do It\n\nJackie House's \"Half A Bar Will Do It\" mix came out 11 months ago, in that post-New Year's, deep-winter stretch of time when dance music in the Northern Hemisphere briefly goes into hibernation. It matches that mood perfectly, easing, over the course of three hours, through soothing, low-energy grooves of all kinds, from Kompakt deep cuts to ambient jungle pitched way, way down. Jackie's photo—swaddled in blankets, bathed in warm lamplight—shows the best way to take this one in. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNosedrip\nLive: Dekmantel Festival 2019\n\nIt's one thing to play a bunch of psychedelic dub and obscure post-punk on the radio. It's something else entirely to mix it at a festival and hold the dance floor. That's what Nosedrip did on the Red Light Radio stage at Dekmantel this summer. Luckily, we now have the recording to pogo to. In the STROOM head's hands, a rare Belgian cut like Siglo XX's \"Individuality\" becomes a statement of purpose: \"I don't wanna be like the others / I am an originality / In search for individuality.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSybil Jason\nBlowing Up The Workshop 103 \n\nSybil Jason's Blowing Up The Workshop mix is only 40 minutes long and it ends abruptly after a particularly satisfying transition. Showcasing her range, this quick, intense and blindsiding mix ranges from weirdo downtempo to synth-pop to techno, as Jason jumps between eras like a skilled time traveler. She had a bigger year than ever in 2019, and it's DJing skills like this that got her there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpekki Webu\nNous'klaer Radio #20\n\nThough trance has been bubbling up again in dance music for a few years now, in 2019 it took centre-stage. While some turned to Eurodance for inspiration, Spekki Webu sought out the throb of the genre's earlier psychedelic forms. This precise set for Nous'klaer Audio is a masterclass in otherworldly DJing, journeying into hallucinogenic, hypnagogic soundscapes before it melts into the ether.",
