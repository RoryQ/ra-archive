Written during a time of deep self-reflection,\n        hooke's law follows keiyaA as she tears everything and everyone\n        up only to emerge more invigorated than ever. Following her beloved\n        debut album, these 19 tracks are a remarkable crossover between R&B,\n        ambient and the kind of experimental music you might expect from\n        genre-adverse producers like Klein and DJ Haram. Soulful and sexy,\n        scornful and weird, the album charts an explosive period of emotional\n        growth.",

On their new EP, IMMIGRANT, they portray the immigrant\n        experience in post-Trump America as oppressive and repetitive. \"Black\n        Trans Masculine Experience\" gives the floor to Kings-Lee Rose, who\n        discusses the societal isolation of Black trans masculine people before\n        a flood of percussion fills the soundscape. In TYGAPAW's hands, deep\n        feelings are meant to be released through the hips—you'll hear Jersey\n        club, dancehall and techno rhythms skitter across \"M32.\"",

Its soulful sound, driven by cruising\n        guitars and euphoric synths, buffs up his candid lyrics, making his\n        verses (which channel the extreme honesty of 2013-era Tyler, the\n        Creator) all the more relatable.

Adi, born in Bogotá and now based in Brussels, has built a\n        steady following for her blends of trippy house, electro and techno,\n        tinged with acid. Taking over from Nicolas Lutz at 7:30 AM, she kept up\n        the momentum with nimble rhythms and just the right amount of sleaze,\n        squelch and restraint.",

The style experiments\n        arrive in flashes. We only wish there were more.",

Gritty, romantic house.\n        The New York producer leaves behind samples to put his own words front\n        and centre, bringing earnest poetry to songs like \"Suddenly,\" where love\n        begets feelings of self-acceptance (\"I feel like I belong / And there's\n        nothing wrong\"). The emotional tone of the EP—and the ecstasy it chases\n        after—is no less driving than his peak-time anthems. On \"Feel Like\n        That,\" over a nasty bassline that slithers close to the floor, he asks,\n        \"How do you feel?\"",

There's a gripping seriousness about her devotion to pleasure across\n        the album, from the trip-hop poetry on \"Girl Feels Good\" to the operatic\n        runs on \"Striptease.\"",

        "description": "Halfway through Nono Gigsta's sequel to her 2018 Freerotation set, also named The House of Crocodiles, we get an indication of the strange title's origins. \"The males' rippling flesh sends soundwaves through the water… humans can barely hear them, but the crocodiles can. Welcome to the House of Crocodiles,\" a sample narrates. And then, oh so naturally, it moves into a roaring electric guitar solo (Led Zeppelin's \"Whole Lotta Love\"). It's a bonkers move that can prompt you to completely rethink what DJing can be. It's also completely natural in the hands of the Belgian DJ.Jaw-dropping transitions dominate this two-hour recording, aptly described as \"Big Blend Academy\" by one commenter. Low-end frequencies anchor the mix as it darts through wild variations in mood and tempo. Dubwise experiments (LUXE's \"Diamond Dub\") morph into frenetic jazz techno (Gigi FM's \"Gabriella\"), sounding like DJ Sprinkles if she dabbled in UK bass. You can feel Gigsta's sense of freedom as she aqueously glides across loose and liquid rhythms.Freewheeling mixes of this sort often risk being overly headsy, but this is a very fun listen that spans Björk, Foster Sylvers and Victoria Monet. The inclusion of more \"popular music\" only adds to the overwhelming sense of feverish delight. There's only one reasonable response to a mix this audacious: \"WTF.\" - Bella Aquilina",

There's a nonchalant swagger underlining every track, as if mirroring her breezy movements. The mood is loose-limbed but there's a high degree of intellect and intention behind each rhythm, just like a Bond girl's alluringly sharp demeanour. - Nyshka Chandran",

For FMB, the London-based artist condensed that two-and-a-half-hour set into this lean power-hour of soulful sub-pressure. Just listen to the way she moves from the soothing resplendence of Ella Fitzgerald to the dank 140 of Slimy, Delta and Obskure within the opening ten minutes.

His powers shine in this live recording from Portugal's Waking Life festival, which brims with otherworldly ambience.

Pairing sugary, Latin freestyle-inspired vocals with huge piano stabs à la 4 For Money's \"It's a Moment in Time,\" it's the kind of turn-of-the-decade anthem you'd expect to hear soundtracking grainy archival footage from Cocoricò or Quadrant Park.Except \"In My Dreams\" isn't from the '90s—it's a new release from contemporary synth pop outfit Nuovo Testamento. Dismiss it as frivolous if you like, but doing so won't diminish the truth: this track is custom-made for massive, life-affirming rave moments. - Michael Lawson",

He's had big drops before, but nothing as gargantuan as the lift-off a minute into \"Juggernaut.\" This is \"Tron\" for a whole new generation. - Henry Ivry",

It's the kind of song that seems forgettable at first listen and totally indispensable by your third, in part because it's so confident. Unlike so much pop this year, \"Nasty\" is so unbothered about proving itself to you that it's easy to dismiss at first glance, even as its rubbery bassline and off-kilter vocal samples build and build.

Sandwiched between a pair of heavier bangers, its comparatively low-key B-side, \"Fawn,\" is a masterful distillation of her signature technoid dubstep. Moving at a subtly brisker clip than traditional 140, the track's bass pulses, spiralling vocals and dubbed-out drums shift and cycle, evoking the earth-rattling march of a giant.After 80 seconds of moody table-setting, a playful series of plucks erupts seemingly from nowhere, skipping up and down in pitch. Then, as quickly as it arrived, this cute riff is gone, displaying Carré's deft control over arrangement. For anyone curious about dark and minimal dubstep's evolution over the past decade, this is the place to start. - Tom Gledhill",

Gordon can evidently sell anything.

Throughout his dazzling debut album, Two Star & the Dream Police, the New Jersey-born artist's warbled vocals are at points barely decipherable—prioritising atmosphere over precision, which cloaks his music in a quixotic, almost Jai Paul-ish mist.On \"Breakthespell,\" his voice melts into the heavily delayed guitars and billowing synths he's become known for. Once you finally manage to decode lyrics, they only heighten the hazy ambience, as he anguishedly calls out: \"I can't win / And I won't end.\" The agent of his heartbreak is unclear; although if the song title offers any hints, it might even be Mk.gee himself. \"Breakthespell\" may not provide clarity, but it doesn't matter—this is the sound of catharsis. - Bella Aquilina",

Occasionally, the transcendental melody is interrupted by a slight key change or the growing swell of indecipherable voices, but it's never enough to unseat the song's steady, meditative pace. \"slob air\" is like watching the sun rise on the top deck of the bus after a bleary night out—life-affirming. - Steph Philips",

Tinashe's \"Nasty\" allowed an anxiety-ridden generation having less casual sex to try on a slutty persona and Charli xcx's carefree BRAT paved a green road from the club to the Vice President's office.As the sun began to set on late summer, avant-pop visionary FKA twigs also chimed in with the sultry mystique of \"Eusexua,\" the title track from her forthcoming album. While muted techno kicks thump in the distance, the song immediately introduces us not only to a feeling (which twigs describes as \"the pinnacle of human experience\"), but also an entire cinematic universe full of alien tattoos, silver statement jewellery, seven-inch Pleasers and sheer lingerie. twigs has always sung around the dance floor's periphery, but on \"Eusexua,\" she's never sounded so sure of her place in the heart of the club. - Kiana Mickles",

In 2024, he met his match in São Paulo funk export RHR, who spent years observing the UK scene from almost 6,000 miles away, fusing his learnings with Brazil's diasporic rhythms. So when he finally got in the ring with Logan, what was the result?The pair's rowdy team-up, \"Diagonal (Dub Mix),\" vaults straight out the blocks with disorientating sample chops and a chest-caving rumble, laying the perfect foundation for the MC's righteous assertions of his own ability to storm onto any track and make himself heard. Stomping bass that slips off its axis; flecks of flanged synth; percussion that reaches for tamborzão—it's a whirlwind of energy. \"Diagonal (Dub Mix)\" is the sound of São Paulo and London colliding spectacularly. - Nathan Evans",

Dance floors haven't exactly been light on wallopers cribbing their sub action from darkside jungle and speed garage lately, so to understand why \"flight fm\" went supernova, it's worth paying attention to what the song doesn't do.\"flight fm\" is no-nonsense enough to make the track it might be modelled on, Si Begg's \"Revolution No 1,\" sound positively cluttered. A dainty pre-tremor, some skippy drums and that enormous, grungy bassline—done. Incredibly effective. Vast pockets of negative space compelled others to fill in the blanks, which is why everyone from ropey TikTok remixers to Future and even The Chainsmokers (yes, seriously) mobbed in.

Its pièce de résistance is the ominous and introspective \"Waiting,\" which features one half of the duo, Julia Sabra, reciting an excerpt from Lebanese poet Etel Adnan's To Be in a Time of War. The words, profoundly poignant on their own, transform simple ongoings of daily life into acts of resistance during wartime.Paired with strong drums, the track opens with an eerie beat reminiscent of a church bell or a loud clock tolling the arrival of doomsday. The combination of Sabra's gradually distorting voice, the increasingly aggressive rhythm and almost mundane lyrics is deeply hypnotic, immersing us in Snakeskin's alternate reality. Yet, like a silver lining amid the heaviness, chimes add a subtle brightness, hinting at the resilience that quietly endures beneath the agony of living through destruction. - Tamara Saade",

It makes sense that amid sustained geo-political violence and economic turbulence, we'd again find solace in shoegaze—music that slows the anxious heart while holding a mirror to deep-rooted angst we prefer to leave unspoken.\"Blinkmoth (July Mix)\" commanded repeat listens this year for an instantaneous pull that sucks you into the muted vortex of James K's romantic solitude. As she sings about the endless transference of love, a trip-hop beat glides and gallops, tactfully situating us in the '90s. But really, it's the heavenly vocals that we're here for. Her delivery glistens with the Elizabeth Fraser effect: carried foremost by feeling, the curvature of her indecipherable lyrics capture the fleeting moment in which euphoria sinks into quiet melancholy. Additions like this to the electronic shoegaze revival should give any non-believer proof of its enduring relevance. - Kiana Mickles",

        "description": "A great pop song is like a charm: compact and entrancing, a daydream corked and uncorked at will. If it can't guarantee good fortune, it can at least transport a listener somewhere they feel lucky to be. And no song in 2024 made as great an escape as Nick León and Erika de Casier's \"Bikini.\"\"It leaks into the music somehow,\" León said earlier this month of growing up by the ocean. The Miami native describes his compositions as spaces to inhabit rather than stories; a personal stamp strong enough to transform any output he lends his hand to, be that ambient (Gloria) or perreo heaters (Rompediskoteka). De Casier wields similar scene-setting skills: she wrote one of 2023's stickiest earworms, New Jeans' \"Super Shy,\" without ever sacrificing her signature delicate style presented to perfection on 2019 breakout album, Essentials.An anthem like \"Bikini\" was always on the cards for the pair: their last collaboration, the Dionysian \"Ex-Girlfriend\" with SHYGIRL, nailed the body-first composition of Nelly Furtado and Timbaland's best work. Harp-like keyboard notes pierce the clip of a bassline, plunging into deep dembow as elegantly as four-on-the-floor. Embracing de Casier's crystalline mezzo-soprano, \"Bikini\" pushes sound into pure sensation: sand between toes and lips on goose-pimpled skin. When she was a teenager, \"going to the swimming pool was the worst thing I could imagine,\" she told Mixmag in 2021. A decade-plus later, \"Bikini\" comes alive in the shedding of those inhibitions: why hedge around the pool, when you could head straight for the sea?Despite \"Bikini\"'s deft movement between shifting rhythmic patterns, the track still manages to capture a profound sense of pause. Trying to make sense of the changing tides—\"Lookin' out there / Tryin' to find a meaning\"—de Casier only finds herself recentered \"with the wind in my hair, just breathing in the air.\" It's these atmospheric tendencies that take \"Bikini\" from the track of September to the track of the year. Before León and de Casier, artists from Otis Redding to Kelela have gazed \"out there,\" hoping to find some sort of solace in the meeting of water and sky. And in a year so rife with misery, there are plenty of reasons to be fearful for the future. But \"Bikini\" charts a different course—it's a three-minute appeal to just be. - Hattie Lindert",

Yet the music's embrace of funk and even melody — a new string to their bow—underlines the duo's conviction that serious music doesn't have to take itself so seriously. - Chloe Lula",

Some may say the compilation leans towards \"guilty pleasure.\" To that, we say: there's no such thing—it's just pleasure. - Katie Thomas",

For the heads, it delivers his signature package of intricately layered sound design, dense percussion, and a wash of echo and reverb. But this time, the DJ devotees get their due as well. ISS010 marks a shift from Skee Mask’s breakbeat explorations to a more dance floor-focused sound, reflecting the heavily house and techno-infused energy of his current DJ sets. The seven-tracker blends syncopated rhythms with gorgeous melodies, weaving flashes of dubstep and ambient textures into rave-ready form. Grime-indebted beats on tracks like “The Bills” could as readily host an MC as send a Detroit loft party into overdrive, while “Double Standard” combines shimmering synths with propulsive drums, making it well suited for introspective home listening or peak-time club play. In a major year for Skee Mask, ISS010 was a record that engaged both body and soul. - Fahad Akinsanya",

Intensity levels escalate to a peak with a clever emphasis on rave fundamentals rather than shock value: there are nasty basslines, tribal influences, elements of rowdy post-dubstep and distorted vocal samples.Tracks are thunderous and jaw-dropping but strategically calibrated, transforming the cadence of Latin rhythms into a throbbing mass of futuristic sound design. Breathe, Godspeed is a radical snapshot of Verraco's music-making philosophy—it disorients, stimulates and, best of all, knows exactly what it wants to say. - Nyshka Chandran",

The first clue that demonstrates the strength of her latest work is opener, \"Kravitz,\" with its funky cello bassline, dark atmospherics and strolling-pace rhythm. It's a fitting introduction to the musician's most accessible album yet, which largely forgoes the murky timbres and synth abstraction of her earlier works.Instead, tracks such as \"Oídos,\" where Fratti's sweet soprano springs above whining trumpet, have spawned comparisons to the jazzy angst of singer-songwriters like Fiona Apple. Or take \"Descubrimos un suspiro,\" where her voice is raw and up close as strings rustle against warm horns. On Sentir Que No Sabes, Fratti takes the threads of her denser projects and weaves it into a richly textured, utterly enthralling tapestry. - Kiana Mickles",

As for Magaletti, the experimental percussionist appears to be driven by a burning desire to constantly break new rhythmic ground, with each of her collaborative projects more ambitious than the last.It's no surprise, then, that their debut joint project, Estradas, sounded like little else this year. The nine-track LP begins as a tense to and fro between two artists feeling each other out, but the moments in which they find a shared musical language are dizzying. It's both a testament to the transcendental powers of rhythm and the thrilling possibilities of improvised collaboration. - Michael Lawson",

Yet it was her XL debut where she truly shot for the moon with a record informed by stargazing and Stephen Hawking as much as Hideo Kojima and Noisia. Li practically undergoes a full villain arc in 23 minutes, staging a shift from tones so crystalline you'd be forgiven for thinking they were beamed direct from the Pillars of Creation, to mottled drumfunk hissing and heaving under the weight of menace.

Queridão, which translates to \"beloved\" from Portuguese, is a collection of tracks that has taken the producer from SoundCloud cult favourite to living legend in the rising funk mineiro scene of Belo Horizonte.The mountainous, landlocked city is widely celebrated for its slower and more melodic take on funk, but what sets Anderson apart is his commitment to downright eerie experimentalism, stripping down the sound's full-bodied elements to forge epic and radical restraint. It's really no wonder that Queridão stands out as some of the most enticingly abstract dance music of the year. - GG Albuquerque",

Cities—and people—have been set alight. On Da Nao Tian Gong, Polygonia makes sense of this destruction through an effervescent mix of ambient, techno and downtempo, using the synthetic to recreate the organic, from a synth pad dawn chorus to the rhythmic hissing of water. Nestled at the heart of this sublime EP lies the simple yet powerful message of protecting our world. The peaches, the seeds, the roots.

The Danish artist has spoken about her time spent in church choirs, acknowledging its role in shaping her vocals: \"I definitely wouldn't be singing as loud as I do.\" On Great Doubt, Sonne is definitely loud, producing immense emotional volume out of sparse arrangements.\"Do you wanna\" arrives with a straight but heavy drum beat as Sonne confesses, \"Do you wanna have a baby? / I really don't know.\" This unnervingly direct existentialism runs through the entire album, whether in the slow, booming 808s on \"Everything is unreal\" or the simple pizzicato viola on \"Almost.\" Sonne doesn't shy away from bold, unembellished statements, only augmenting the sense of intimacy (as on the plaintive, Ben Vince-assisted \"Say you love me\").

With BRAT, she swung to please her niche—and ended up painting the summer radioactive green. Her most momentous album to date is a rare animal: a galvanising pop record all wound up for the club on one hand, a glistening smorgasbord of spilled guts on the other.By turning her insecurities inside out on songs like \"Sympathy is a knife\" and \"Girl, so confusing,\" then counterweighting those cerebations with the whole-body release of \"Von dutch\" and \"Club classics,\" Charli alchemised a new vision of her own success. She's long picked over the question of what it means to make it. BRAT homes in on something of an answer: there's no \"it\" to make. Sell all the records you want, or don't—you have to come home to yourself either way. Might as well crank the bass and dance through it. - Sasha Geffen",

As smoky pads permeate the air, the beat decelerates into half-time—only a quick moment to gather your waist before the wine-inducing rhythms of \"Bubbling Meets Kaseko,\" which fuse bubbling's restless kicks with traditional Surinamese skratji percussion.

        "description": "Not waving, or drowning, but drifting. That's how 2024 felt for many of us: a serotonin crash made all the more raw by an increasingly cruel world. After years of clubland electrifying the masses with the shock of the new, we chose to lean the other way, prioritising cosy records that made you thankful for what you already have (a craving that, in alternative circles, drew people to the spectral-jukebox transmissions of Cindy Lee like moth to flame). Into this climate landed a masterclass in softer vibrations from Brian Leeds, who, as Huerco S. and Pendant, has already proved himself a master of suspended animation several times over. One Day both encapsulated the mood and cut through it like a beacon.Does it augur poorly for a culture built on progression to take a step back and recalibrate? Well, the past was priced in; Loidis is the ancient name for Leeds, after all. And though One Day was built around slippery micro rhythms and delayed dub stabs, Leeds hardly soapboxed for a return to subtlety. The strongest promo was essentially happenstance, after he termed the project \"dub mnml emo tech\" to wriggle out of anything too formal, but wound up perfectly articulating its playful vibe.Just as For Those Of You…'s truncated loops were a creative sleight-of-hand, One Day pulls off a sly trick throughout. Leeds mimics the lossy compression and audio degradation favoured by the clicks 'n cuts set, only this time using stem separation software and creative resampling that falls closer, he told us, to hypermodern genres. In doing so, he created a shapeshifting palette: all muzzled kicks, panned basslines bobbing through hyaline textures and indulgent codas tacked onto nine- or ten-minute tunes (\"Why Do,\" \"Love's Linneaments,\" \"Sugar Snot\") that you could have sworn flashed by in four. It scans as wrong at first blush, so you're compelled to run it back a dozen times—by which point, naturally, it sounds exceptional.One Day doesn't just revitalise styles that faded from favour; it glows with the patience of Shinchi Atobe and DJ Sprinkles, the frolic of Isolée and Dinky, the 3 AM soul-searching of Claro Intelecto and Paul St. Hilaire. Most obviously, the spirit of Alcachofa and Vocalcity feel hardcoded into its DNA. These are records that have meant a lot to people over the years, made by artists who have stood the test of time. I'd be lying if I didn't think Leeds is in that conversation now.When it arrived, One Day might have seemed too discrete to break out, but months of compulsive listening have upended that. If we're resting at a waystation en route to a destination as-yet-unclear, there was no more generous or agreeable companion. So while there aren't many conclusions to be drawn from the discomforting haze of 2024, this much is true: the album that felt primed to take a slow stroll to classic status has raced way ahead of schedule. It's already there. - Gabriel Szatan",

This was a deliberate choice, she explained, to have everything stripped back so audiences could see her—and hear her—for all she was. But up there, the blue lights around her dimmed, it was clear that her solitary figure also reflected her more bitter-than-sweet struggles against what she described as \"male stoicism.\" This remark came from the revelations she had while reading The Will to Change, an investigation of men, masculinity and love by the radical Black feminist scholar bell hooks. Her epiphany was painstakingly reflected in the dancehall derivation \"On The Run\": \"You get around enough / Too busy actin' tough / Give me a softer side / I won't wait all night.\" Patriarchal culture doesn't only hurt women, Kelela discovered—it also restricts the way men are able to explore intimacy and achieve wholeness for themselves.\n\nI saw Kelela perform in Berlin. 13 of Raven's 15 tracks were produced there, and it shows. There's a sorrow and solemnity woven into the city's monochromatic corners that echo through Raven, like a pebble rattling in an empty aluminium can. Even the title track is underpinned by a spacious yearning, as if on the brink of a breaking point—\"Took all my labour / Don't tell me that I'm strong,\" she sings, before gradually trotting into a heaving 4/4 beat, a subtle nod to clubbing as escapism. By the album's conclusion, \"Far Away,\" Kelela finds her deliverance in the form of honeyed ad-libs undulating over sounds of crashing waves, as if signalling that with enough time and perspective, all pain can be alchemised into pure spirit. -Whitney Wei",

Through visceral lyrics that underline the idea of desire as a truly physical sensation, the ex-Chairlift vocalist sings of self-indulgent surrender to a lover without the slightest care of appearing desperate or needy. But it's the production—from Polachek and Danny L. Harle—that truly makes this a multifaceted pop record: feathery drum & bass, flamenco, dreamy rock and bassy R&B bops add to the physicality of Polachek's feelings, pushing her theatrical vocals outside of the shielded realm of inner thoughts and into the material world. -Nyshka Chandran\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

Raised on pirate radio, folktronica, free jazz and everything in between, he conjures up mythical fairy tales where flickers of dance music past meander into pastoral soundscapes. This all culminated with Imagine This Is A High Dimensional Space Of All Possibilities, which marks a welcome return to the club for Holden—or his version of it, anyway. Recognisable dance music tropes (hints of dub techno, echoes of house, microdoses of rave) nestle into the rich and complex instrumentation that gives all of Holden's music its distinctive flair.

On their latest LP of heart-tugging R&B, Levi's tough 808s and trilling piano sketches hold a steady, unrelenting pace while Tirzah pours her heart into 11 rough-and-ready love songs.

Each track packs a smouldering punch and Levi's distorted piano melodies on tracks like \"F22\" and \"Promises\" have Grand Cru earworm qualities. The album turns Tirzah and Levi's often ramshackle songs into a steamrolling train that tugs at the heartstrings all the harder, while still holding onto the lightweight feel that makes all of the project's music so enchanting. -Conor McTernan\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

Regal86, a buzzy producer from Monterrey makes all kinds of music, but he's particularly good at hardgroove. His album La Onda landed at the perfect time to take the revival to the next level. With breathless sequencing and expert programming, this is hard, fast dance music that doesn't bludgeon you over the head, but instead invites you to dance and get lost in its intricacies.

Those particles are rearranged into gentle compositions that inhale and exhale like a living respiratory system, with melodies that appear like clouds on the horizon before rolling away and letting the music clear up again. Atlas takes the fearless compositional framework of past albums and her ear for slight-but-dazzling melodies and presents them in a new, almost neoclassical way.

        "description": "PríncipeDJ Danifox - Ansiedade\nTraditionally, batida is a sound characterised by a lively interplay of emotions and energies: roiling drums, racing tempos and rousing vocals. Lisbon label Príncipe has long documented the genre's many faces, from electro bangers to housey grooves, and this stunning offering from one of its core members reveals a foggier take. The slow-burning LP unravels like a gentle love letter, pairing intuitive, staccato drums with conversational vocals and lush instrumentation (guitar and woodwinds). There are hints of jazz, trap and dub techno—perhaps a reference to batida's own cross-pollination from various Angolan and Portuguese styles—and a thread of tenderness and toughness. Danifox's lilting melodies wrap batida's bounce into a dulcet, romantic daze. -Nyshka Chandran\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

Part of the reason why is because the album's palette sounds eerily familiar, like every phenomenal downtempo album released before the turn of the millennium blended into one. But it's not pastiche: the lyrics feel bitingly modern and the production is taken to outer space in ways their predecessors didn't yet have the language for.

Kourtesis's music has always been connected to familial relationships—2021's Fresia Magalena EP was named after Fresia (her mother) and Magdalena (the district in Lima where she's from) while reflecting on the death of her father—but with each new record her music becomes an even more personal, ecstatic and richly layered collage. Madres deftly combines house music with field recordings from indigenous communities, the Peruvian cajón drum, clips from a protest against homophobia and pan-Latin American rhythms. Kourtesis makes restorative, kaleidoscopic house music that blooms from her heart and tugs at the strings of others, highlighting the power of dance floor healing.\n-Katie Thomas\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music",

The most striking among them is the anxious tremble of \"Metal,\" interpolated between syncopated drums, and \"Silk,\" all sly chimes and rotund basslines.

        "description": "Leon Vynehallfabric presents\nCreative pressure is a very real thing for artists. How does one constantly evolve and meet—even surpass—their best work? Leon Vynehall seems to know the answer. Since 2018's powerful conceptual album Nothing Is Still, the UK musician has matured from a talented club producer into a storyteller par excellence, weaving original and compelling narratives through sound. 2019's RA-recommended DJ-Kicks was one of the best mixes that year. Now, in 2022, he's charted again.\n\nLike DJ-Kicks, fabric presents Leon Vynehall is all about dynamics, except this time the focus is on the club. You'd think that might be restrictive, but Vynehall is a master at finding common threads and energies in disparate musical worlds. Here, work by Mala, A2, Or:la, Ehua, Lady Blacktronika, Commodo, Hagan, Skee Mask and textures from so many other producers hang together in a smoky, soulful soup. The stitching is sublime, the music consistently excellent. At points, it's enough to take your breath away. —Carlos Hawthorn",

        "description": "Joe DelonLive At Dimensions 2021\nHot take: Joe Delon likes dance music more than just about anyone. He tours all the time, but still finds time to write a regular newsletter about everything going on around him. As a DJ he exudes enthusiasm, playing groovy records that run the gamut from sleek contemporary tech house to old school Italo classics. This live recording from Dimensions captures his range perfectly: he starts low and slow, but just as things get a bit heady, he makes a U-turn with the outrageous vocal track \"Adventure\" by Eleanor and Shep Pettibone. From there, things dart between the cerebral and the cheesy. Vintage hip house gives way to G-funk-laced electro and acid before dissipating into celestial techno and old school rave. It's hard to imagine that even the security team wasn't losing it during this masterclass in Tisno. —Henry Ivy",

Speaking of transitions, they're all remarkably seamless as Yumi blends together odd tracks at various tempos, gradually pulling off a 30 BPM change so impeccably that you barely notice it.

Seemingly unknown during the recesses of the pandemic, he catapulted to international acclaim in the last 18 months, not only because of his unanticipated glut of speed-demon dance floor releases—all of which skirt the 150 BPM mark—but also because of his position at the helm of a refreshing new trend towards nimble, groovy techno. His HÖR Berlin mix from January this year perfectly encapsulates this style. Minimal yet replete with understated hooks, it layers psychedelic flurries of toms with tribal drums, house vocals and trancey melodic fills. Strategically moving from rhythmic tracks to deep peak-time riffs and back, he showcases here why he's become such a lauded underground tastemaker—and a name to watch. —Chloe Lula",

The fact that we'll likely never know the answer is part of the fun (plus, it's not like we'd be able to find any of the records he plays anyways). This two-hour treasure trove of all things '90s sees Joyce in particularly bouncy and jubilant form. There are Latin-flavored rhythms, vintage NY vocals, and little bits of proper late night garage. The mixing is seamless without being showy, and Joyce keeps us on the edge of our seats the whole time, wondering what Shazam-breaking gem he'll reach for next. —H.I.",

The Miami producer is at the forefront of a new wave of 305-area artists who fuse together the city's unique tapestry of Hispanic cultures—and its deep connections to Latin America—with its robust dance music history. León specifically mixes influences from reggaeton and perreo into what is sometimes termed \"Latin tribal techno,\" but whatever you want to call it, there's no denying the appeal of \"Xtasis,\" the track most of us heard out on dance floors more than any other, by a country mile.\n \n\"Xtasis,\" a collaboration with Venezuelan raptor house pioneer DJ Babatr, is a good example of the intercontinental cross-pollination happening within this scene. The percussion plays a trick, both four-on-the-floor and broken at the same time, at a chemically-enhanced pace with distant vocal wails that add a lysergic flair. But \"Xtasis\"—and its accompanying Pearson Sound and Doctor Jeep remixes—really clicks with the old-school organ bassline that drops in at about the two-minute mark. It's something so simple, so familiar and, frankly, genius, that by the time the kick drum drops back in, the room should be in a frenzy.

Despite its light-hearted nature, \"Come Quick\" is still loaded with sharp corners and jolting melodies—a true day to dusk record. —Nyshka Chandran\n \nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

On an EP filled with massive, celebratory tracks, Ahadadream's \"Spaceship\" was colossal. Every few bars it felt like he was shifting his reference points. What starts as a UK-funky-meets-gqom hybrid morphs into a dubstep throwback with its airy, descending melody. But then the xylophone chimes and upbeat snares capture the maximalism of TNGHT records. As the inadequacy of comparison should make clear, though, \"Spaceship\" is sui generis, announcing the arrival of a new torchbearer for all things big and bassy. —H.I. \n \nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

It's been even longer since he released dance music in his own right. Caterpillar, then—which came out in June on Voam, the label he runs with Blawan—is an exciting interruption to this interlude. The hypnotic title track is capital-T techno, but it's heavily textured and nuanced, layering dense modular noodlings with a repeating guttural squelch that sounds more like an off-the-cuff live rip than the polished veneer of most of today's peak-time output. Flanged-out percussion, sizzling analog stabs and a spacey, Pole Group-like synth lead make it the ultimate selection for breaking open a late night set. —Chloe Lula\n \nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

Case in point, \"Step 2,\" which kicked off Nair's own label n goes to infinity. It starts out as hectic uptempo acid jungle track, before crescendoing into a halftime breakdown full of metallic skronks and other aural detritus.

The rest of the song is beguilingly simple; the propulsive kick-and-tom pattern continues uninterrupted under a single-note cowbell, never changing except for a brief drop about two-thirds in. GiGi FM, an alumnus of both the New York City Ballet and the Alvin Ailey Theatre, has said that the release is a testament to the ritualistic relationship between movement and music.

        "description": "Half Baked RecordsMargaret Dygas - Butterfly Effect\nThe best minimal tracks are all about attention to detail, so it should come as no surprise that Margaret Dygas' \"Butterfly Effect\" clocks in at 9:09. The track is immersed in the micro world of details as she dilates and contracts looped conga drums, 909s, a creeping synthline and stormy pressure from her subs. Simple but effective, Dygas approaches these elements with a surgeon's precision as she moves them up and down in the mix. This was Dygas's first 12-inch in over half a decade, a welcome return of one of minimal's weirdos-in-chief. \"Butterfly Effect\" is a reminder of the strange sense of wonder that only the best minimal can create, where it feels like a loop could go on forever. —H.I. \n \nListen:\nSoundcloud",

        "description": "Epic RecordsUtada Hikaru - Somewhere Near Marseilles\nThe year's greatest grown-and-sexy jam came out of an unlikely collaboration between the biggest J-pop star of all time and UK house producer Floating Points. Starting with the flicker of an acid line, \"Somewhere Near Marseilles\" unfolds over 11 minutes of exquisitely produced house, bobbing and glimmering in all the right places. Hikaru sings what feels like three different choruses in a mixture of English and Japanese, glamourously exhorting their lover to meet them in Marseilles as an in-between point between London and Paris. \"Let's go fast, then go slow,\" they repeat over the constantly morphing instrumental track. It's a snippet of luxury and contentment that feels as lush as the song sounds, only improved by Hikaru's impeccable vocal performance—the way she sings, \"I'm in London / You're in Paris\" is both commanding and effortlessly cool. It's rare that the pleasures of pop and house music come together this well, a cosmopolitan adult contemporary jam made for the most amourous hours of the night. —A.R. \n \nListen:\nApple Music / Spotify",

The summer streets come alive with reggae and hip-hop; house music wafts in through FM radio or from the cracked window of your longtime neighbour. The vital life force and diversity of the city's sounds has coloured Kush Jones's discography over the years. He typically releases music—drawing from house, jungle, footwork and hip-hop—independently at a fast clip. One of his many works from this year was 6 Days, an EP that was written in, you guessed it, six days. Within a record that shifts rapidly between house and juke, the highlight comes from the pensive pads, idle, honey-sweet melody and subtle percussion on opener \"BX Bounce,\" embodying the very best of New York's intangible cultural heritage. —K.M. \n \nListen:\nBandcamp",

The internet, arbiter of half-baked opinions, waxed enthusiastic about house music's reinvigoration within the commercial mainstream. In many ways, \"Break My Soul\" was formulaic in its hitmaking: it flung gruff yak'ing samples of New Orleans bounce legend Big Freedia (\"release ya trade / release the stress / release the love / forget the rest\") into a looping bassline inspired by Robin S.'s 1990 smash \"Show Me Love\"—even tapping into the post-pandemic cultural zeitgeist of saying \"fuck it\" and quitting your job. But the key to any liberation anthem is confidence, not necessarily originality, and Beyoncé stands on the shoulders of the tried-and-true house heroes that came long before her to successfully ignite the masses. —W.W. \n \nListen:\nApple Music / Spotify / Soundcloud",

Tiffany & Roza Terenzi - Edge Of Innocence\nElectronic music is something of an ouroboros: sounds hark back to the past as trends recycle in a never-ending loop. The revival of genres like jungle and trance, among others, is proof positive, and the subject of many articles from cultural critics like Simon Reynolds and Mark Fisher. But there's a distinction to be made here. Some artists' chase of rose-tinted nostalgia is nothing more than empty cliché, while others treat their return to a bygone era like a hero's journey—familiar, yet eclipsed by a new, fortified sensibility.\n\nD. Tiffany and Roza Terenzi achieve the ideal balance on their debut album, Edge Of Innocence. It offers a mélange of influences that run the hi-BPM gamut from electro to drum & bass without losing grip of the rippling, psychedelic groove at the core of everything this duo do. \"Grains Of Sand\" is a case in point, replete with synths that stab through a thicket of lumbering percussion, as is the fittingly named breakbeat bop \"Redemption Arc,\" kitted out with all the sleek dynamism that emerges after a period of dark contemplation. By the end of Edge Of Innocence, you get the feeling that, though the duo are working with well-worn sounds, they've made them all their own. -Whitney Wei\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

Like a summary of his history of making weirdo IDM hip-hop and mainstream rap, Cry Sugar is the Glaswegian producer's most epic and wide-ranging LP, chock full of earwormy melodies, left-turn smackdowns and the symphonic pomp-and-circumstance that makes his work one of a kind. You can hear the last ten years of rap music refracted through Birchard's many-sided prism, which is often as funny as it is heavy as it is genius. Like the title implies, Cry Sugar careens from the depressed to the euphoric, each feeling pumped up to the scale of a Marvel movie. -Andrew Ryce\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

Here, intermittent rain is depicted as a flurry of lustrous synths, \"14°C\" is transformed into pensive arpeggios—the playfully jagged IDM she's revered for—and sounds hiccup and stop-start across placid pads all over the LP.

Björk has been making music for over three decades now, and with each record she steps into mystical, uncharted territory, creating work which is ever more beguiling, more avant-garde and always, somehow, even more Björk. On Fossora, Björk sings with a sweeping gravitas over rich woodwinds and distorted gabber beats, the additional instrumentation dancing around her vocal as she muses on the circle of life, nature and her own late mother. Digging her fingers into the earth, Björk unknots tributaries of tangled roots, the crashing drum patterns and complex textures representing the stark, breathtaking topography of her homeland. -Katie Thomas\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

Between prime minister jockeying, mini-budgets and a volatile currency, Steven Goodman returned as Kode9 with a record that made the perfect accompaniment for the instability of the modern UK landscape. Written to accompany an experimental video game about Scotland leaving the union, Escapology operates along a dual axis, at once anxious—filled with eerie bits of sci-fi chatter and dense layers of swelling feedback—but also hopeful, at least when he turns to club tracks. \"Uncoil,\" for example, is a pearl half-covered in sand somewhere between drum & bass and footwork, while \"Cross The Gap\" uses the negative space of dub to create something glimmering in the weight of the darkness around it. -Henry Ivy\n\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

Meeting With The King takes the moody sonics of the gqom—born from township house parties—and makes it polished, opulent, even melodic, honouring the origins of the sound while adding catchy elements of amapiano, house, Afrotech and more. The title is boastful, but it's not wrong—on Meeting With The King, DJ Lag stakes his claim and continues his ascent, taking his musical family along for the ride. -K.T. \n\n\n\nListen:\nApple Music / Spotify",

Songs like \"Body Type\" and \"Dungeon Crawler\" are deceptively simple production-wise, but their repetitive choruses are the stuff that makes crossover hits. It's easy to imagine waiting for the train in the early morning hours after the rave, deliriously looping these brash three-note motifs again and again through your head.  -Chloe Lula\n\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

As the Chicago house genius has advanced in his career, he's slowly luxuriated into a silky fusion sound that plucks from jazz, Balearic and soft rock in the spirit of carefully considered collaborators, like Texan psych-rock trio Khruangbin or Italian ambient composer Gigi Masin. \"Admira,\" for instance, unfurls alongside loose bongo drums like a satisfying slow yawn after a midday slumber. Dappled sunlight patchworks \"Flos Potentia,\" bound together by strumming bass guitar, and \"On My Way Home,\" an earnest, jazzy sonic panacea for the oft-jaded ennui of modern music.

Whether he's making jacking house, experimental noise or blown-out techno, his work is defined by its sense of pure energy as he whips his machines into a frenzy. You'll find plenty of that rawness on his first LP for Modern Love, but where Thanks 4 The Tracks U Lost stands apart is in its surprising tenderness. Don't get me wrong—the drums have plenty of edge, and Moss still pushes his synthesizers to their breaking points—but the record is strikingly wistful, making for one of the most beautiful and tenderhearted of the many albums he's released. -H.I.\n\n\n\nListen:\nApple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

The process for making Sicko could be described as a collective effort. The LP was recorded in the years following 2016's tragic Ghost Ship fire, which ended up killing 36 people in an unlicensed warehouse. Sicko was an integral part of their healing journey as a survivor. There's palpable catharsis written into the energetic pulse of the album, which bleeds several genres into a satisfyingly cohesive mix that makes it difficult to discern where one song ends and another begins. Ambient sequences with knotty sections that twinkle and flutter turn into spaced out dub and then, somewhere along the way, listeners are transported to post-punk-leaning IDM. The songs sprawl out slowly, but capped at six tracks, the LP is actually quite short, emblematic of the slowness of grief and the unpredictable, dynamic moments that accompany it. -K.M.\n\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

Even putting her signature violin to the sidelines doesn't distract from her unique songwriting style.

The tracks throughout Neurotelepathy aren't predictable arrangements made for club play. They're spare and considered, making exquisite use of spatial sound design, spectral percussion and arpeggiated melodies.

As the first full-length work from the duo after a series of collaborative EPs, Nothing To Declare sees the two artists claiming their matriarchal stake in electronic music. Haram's frenetic electronics speak in dialogue with Moor Mother's throaty vocals, delivered with a potent urgency. \"Things ain't been the same since they put the lynch on us / water thicker than blood they convinced us,\" Ayewa opines. She's always been fearless in her delivery, but it's Muzeyyen's jagged productions that drive the point home. -W.W.\n\n\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

Case in point: this LP from Cairo producer ABADIR, which combines a freewheeling style of jungle with Arabic rhythms. This is music that sounds permanently out of breath, feeding off its own excitable energy. Inspired by maqsoum music and the humid bustle of the Egyptian capital, Mutate features impossibly funky beats shrouded in thick field recordings and melodies that hang in the air like smog. It's a vision of the kind of global club music that SVBKVLT has always championed, and one of the best records in a catalogue that constantly ups the ante for where club music can go next. -A.R.\n\n\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

The 3D-rendered opal on the cover of Batu's debut album is just that: a unique kaleidoscope of colours. Icy blue, vibrant green and a hot, lava red contrast with the grey underside of the opal and the moody background. Examining Opal's cover gives a strong sense of the sounds within. 11 tracks of sharp (though sometimes soft), complex and unpredictable electronic sculptures, a world of intricate sound design that Batu said he intended to feel vivid and transportive. Like so many LPs released this year, Opal is a lockdown record, made when Batu was in an introspective and contemplative state of mind, experimenting with moving away from club 12-inches and into a space more vulnerable and experimental. -K.T.\n\n\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

The album is brighter than anything we'd heard from twigs before. Gone is the operatic austerity of MAGDALENE. Instead, Caprisongs  is a pop album with a capital P. The album mines from Afrobeats, grime, baile funk and R&B. It also sources from her personal life via snippets of conversations she recorded with loved ones. The immersive world she creates here deals with insecurity, \"stupid boys\" and friendship, but it's also celebratory. The world had opened up, after all. Twigs might have had a cry now and then, but at least she was doing it on the dance floor in the album's first single, \"Tears In The Club.\". As phenomenal as Caprisongs is, it's somehow even more impressive because it was pulled off with a welcome sense of humour. The album title, for example, is inspired by astrology—her \"stubborn Caprisun ass telling her to work through the pain.\" Listeners can even eavesdrop on an astrological reading by the album's close. Sometimes, a little stubbornness is worth it. -K.M.\n\n\n\n\nListen:\nApple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

It's all tune for tune,\" Theo Parrish said outside the familiar NTS stall in Dalston's Gillett Square. And he doesn't just talk to talk. Many DJs claim to play across genres, but there are \"many DJs\" and then there is Theo Parrish. Over the past few years, the historically private artist has given fans a near-unprecedented view into his creative mind, first with the lengthy and unclassifiable sonic essay-meets-radio drama We Are All Georgeous Monsterss, and then this year with a six-and-a-half hour mix for NTS called \"Eargoggles.\" (Parrish also dropped another six-hour mix close to press time.) \n\nEargoggles is a marathon celebration of the infinite diversity of Black music, spanning from hard bop to hip-hop, searing psych rock to roots reggae. No random grab bag, this is a grand narrative and the revelation of a modern canon of soul with appearances by James Brown, The Congos and D'Angelo. The mix is an education unto itself—around hour five Parrish drops \"Jazz Cats Part 1,\" a cut consisting of Madlib breathlessly laying out his key jazz influences—yet it's also a generous statement of purpose bursting with joy and urgency.\n\n25 years into his career, Parrish gives us an exhaustive guide to the music that makes him tick, that has informed his own enduring classics. But why now? He explains the gravity of his convictions in the final moment of the magisterial \"Eargoggles\" mix:\n\nI'm hoping that at some point during this... After you've had a ride, a musical ride with me, that you take a moment to consider the troubles that you have, and consider that you're lucky to have them.\n\nEven if it doesn't affect you demographically, you should seriously consider the fact that there's an urgency that should be lived, in respect for those that get taken from us early under the guise of 'serve and protect.'\n\nSo let's survive together. But let's remember them together as well. Let's not forget how we treat each other when the music's playing and how things change when the lights go on and we all go back to the rest of our lives.\n\nLet's go back with a little more urgency and care for the fellow man. Let's give a damn a little bit. And if we can do that, we got a better place.—Matt McDermott",

Though Sweeney has since brought Beats In Space back via Apple Music, last March he unexpectedly wrapped up his term on WNYU with episode #1085. Listeners flooded the comment section on a YouTube livestream after the news broke, thanking him for his illustrious tenure. For the finale, Sweeney played Beats In Space classics that highlighted the show's connection to the history of New York City dance music, dropping in an eclectic selection from Alicia Myers, Chaz Jankel and Arnold Jarvis.

But that would be a hasty judgement, as once it approaches the one-hour mark, the energy intensifies with such careful, gradual restraint that even the active listener might wonder how they even got to this point. Sure enough, the mix ultimately reaches a dark, slinky plateau with a bubbling, percussive roller and then rockets off from there. \"sit on my interface (2/2)\" can't arrive soon enough.—K.M.",

        "description": "Poly KicksOvermono - So U Kno\n2021 felt like Overmono's breakthrough year. Each new release of theirs seemed to outdo the last, from the euphoric rave of \"Pieces Of 8\" to their pitch-perfect fabric mix to the peppy garage of \"Diamond Cut\" (one of the major highlights from what was arguably the year's best Essential Mix). But it was \"So U Kno,\" released not on the duo's usual home of XL Recordings but on their own, smaller Poly Kicks imprint, that made it into what felt like every DJ set of the post-reopening world.\n\nLike so much of Overmono's recent work, there's a whiff of a bygone, post-dubstep era to \"So U Know.\" Built around an unforgettable vocal chop, \"So U Kno\" is the kind of track that elicits cheers from a dance floor the minute the DJ starts to mix it in. It has one of those in-between beats—kind of house, kind of 2-step, kind of techno—and a thrill-ride of a breakdown. Encapsulating the frenzied, overjoyed vibe of the summer's post-reopening clubbing with a hint of wistful nostalgia, \"So U Kno\" perfectly sums up this year's excitement and radical ups and downs.—Andrew Ryce\n\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

She became a musical sensation just for releasing snippets of songs on the video app before the full versions appeared on streaming services. Anyone who hadn't heard of PinkPantheress probably did when she finally released the music video for \"Just for me,\" an early '00s-inspired visual depicting her on a studio stage with a sulky crew of emo kids. The Mura Masa co-produced track nodded to garage and early '00s pop-rock, perfectly encapsulating \"new nostalgic,\" a term PinkPantheress uses to describe her own sound. If the lyrics—which follow a stalker's infatuation with a crush—are unsettling, it's intentional. The song was inspired by the obsessive themes that run through Eminem's \"Stan,\" and is more a practice in dramatic storytelling than a portrayal of real-life events. Much like the rest of her catalog, which is tailor-made for bright-eyed Gen Z TikTokers with short attention spans and a love for danceable, snappy hooks, \"Just for me\" hovers around two minutes in length—just long enough to make you want to press rewind and hear it all over again.—Kiana Mickles\n\nListen:\nApple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

In just under three minutes, Nyame mixes airy highlife guitar, Afrobeats and amapiano. Her vocal, meanwhile, is unapologetically carnal: \"Don't waste my time / I wanna bust down, bust down / Go rounds, go rounds / lights out, lights out.\" Modern dance music often feels like it's designed for some airless dungeon.

The LP's ten tracks display extraordinary sonic detail and inventiveness. \"Joy Squad\" sticks out as a granular reimagining of a big room anthem. Chopped-up shards of melody and vocals combine with cinematic strings in a kaleidoscopic funhouse of a track that would be overwhelming if it wasn't so concise.—M.M.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

They're classic hallmarks of the genres—once you hear them, it's difficult to mistake what you're listening to. The key elements of ballroom music, a style intrinsically tied to its dance culture, have understandably caught the eye of numerous club producers in recent years. And Bapari, a Brooklyn-based artist whose music draws from all manner of East Coast club styles, is one of the latest to be inspired. On the title track of their Daybreak EP, the \"Ha\" stab, rather than assuming its traditional role of accentuating the melody, becomes the melody across a frenzy of playful, whip-sawing crashes.

Although we can't in good faith recommend doing 160 MPH on the A406, we can put our weight behind this fuzzy footwork-jungle fusion, which showcases how SHERELLE can flex in the box just as much as she can behind the decks.—Emeka Okonkwo\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

As part of the LP's virtual club experience—a four-story rave complex called Harlecore—Harle's tributes border on parody at certain moments. But at others he stumbles upon gold. \"Boing Beat\" is unapologetic, E'd-up euphoria taken to unnatural highs with MC Boing's manic vocals and Hannah Diamond's girlish, synthetic hook.. While Boing's half-screamed deliveries can be jarring at times, with lyrics as wholesome as \"Everyone here is safe and nice / Makes me wanna have a great life,\" how could we do anything but smile and dance?—E.O.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

On their sophomore album, producers Joshua Inyang and Joshua Reid created a series of nocturnal meditations, a series of nineteen short tracks bleeding into one another, in tribute to their hometown of Manchester. The duo's instrumentation is replete with field recordings of urban white noise, balanced by resonant cellos, hazy guitars and spectral guest performances with fragments of profound conversations—as if overheard from the night before—resulting in the audio equivalent of subconscious dreamscape. \n\nPut simply by Inyang and Reid themselves, Honest Labour is \"an album about love and loss.\" The track \"Indigo Grit,\" for instance, abruptly ends just as the speaker is about to explain the difference between liking and loving someone—a fleeting snippet of wisdom lost just before listeners could grab hold of it. But as with any inquiries into life’s most existential questions, the artists weren't intending to arrive at any conclusions. Through their album, they embraced the sheer mystery of the human experience, remaining at the mercy of their emotions just like the rest of us.—Emeka Okonkwo\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

Bringing together some of the finest downtempo cuts from both lesser-known names like MDA Analog and lesser-known projects from established  names (like Move D and Roman Flügel), the compilation creates a half-lidded world where kick drums dreamily float in and out of focus. Virtual Dreams maps a time when the boundaries between electronic music for the club and the living room weren’t totally solidified, occupying a corridor space between the chill-out room and the dance floor. —Henry Ivry.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

But Skee Mask has always excelled in the album format, and the extended run time allowed him to cover more ground than ever before. Pool takes the plunge into the sui generis cannabis haze of its soundscapes, where Skee Mask put his love of ambient atmosphere and UK dance music into conversation with bits of soulful funk, jazz and some of his fastest tempos yet (Pool went north of the 170 Arctic Circle at points). But, as only Skee Mask can, he creates an immersive and singular trip where genres come second to the textural richness and detail of his soundscapes, which range from danceable to stop-you-in-your-tracks gorgeous—H.I.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / SoundCloud",

The album functions both as a travel diary and love song. It documents a tour through her native China from Qingdao to the far-west city of Xining, recorded in different cities across the country where Yu Su both reconnected with her homeland and found a whole new community of electronic producers she was previously cut off from. The album is appropriately restless and exploratory, as Yu Su charts a path through geography and genres, from slo-mo breakbeat to Krautrock to dubby downtempo. —H.I.\n\nListen: \nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

How Much Time It Is Between You And Me?, is just as unsettling and eerie as it is delicate. The album uses these mixed emotions—as well as touches of post-rock melodrama and angst—to create a liminal state between waking and dreaming held together by Zakharenko's voice, which guides you through labyrinths that can be nightmarish but, just as quickly, morph into luxurious daydreams. —H.I.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

Never The Right Time polished that rusting patina into Stott's most accessible album to date. \"Don't Know How\" is, by his standards, nearly bubblegum. This was true across the board on the record—even the abrasive mechanical rain of \"Answers\" ends with an uplifting, choral melody.

The album opens a new chapter for Stroboscopic Artefacts, not only by featuring a queer, trans outsider artist, but by presenting a volatile, rave-adjacent sound palette beyond the label's wheelhouse.

Amapiano Now, the 16-track compilation from NTS, is a bluffer's guide to the new South African dance phenomenon. From established acts like Vigro Deep and Gaba Canal to upstarts like Teno Afrika, the Shannen SP and Joe Cotch-curated collection demonstrates the inherent mid-tempo sensuality of amapiano, the thrilling sound of a generation of artists discovering their powerful collective voice. —Matt McDermott\n\nListen:\nSpotify / Soundcloud",

Instead, Sam Shepherd and the legendary Pharoah Sanders show a staggering knack for subtlety. Building upon a searching motif of four seven-note chords, both Shepherd and Sanders play with extraordinary humility. The careful arrangements serve as a backdrop for Sanders' restrained sax soloing, but the record doesn’t headline one artist over the other. Instead it reaches for an ineffable oneness, the pinnacle of improvised exploration. Each gradual change feels monumental, like the spaced-out synth exploration on \"Movement 7\" or the Hammond organ passed through a vibrating Leslie speaker on \"Movement 8.\" That Promises holds its own—and even stands out—within one of the most important catalogues in jazz is a remarkable achievement. —M.M.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

Moving out of the city and giving birth to two children, Tirzah examined other forms of love, like the camaraderie between creative partners or the bond between parent and child. Some tracks here make it difficult to parse whether she is referring to a lover, a relative or an old childhood friend, but the universality of it all makes Colourgrade a record that will age gracefully with repeated listens. Adding to its introspective beauty and warmth, the album is brought to life with grainy production and endearing imperfections (a cough here, incomprehensible whispers there). Charmingly unpolished and grounded in a human need we can all agree on—love—it's an album that encourages listeners to cherish life's smallest, most precious moments. —K.M.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

        "description": "N & J BlueberriesHTRK - Rhinestones\nPeople rarely talk about their favourite \"band\" anymore. HTRK, the Australian duo comprising Jonnine Standish and Nigel Yang, are one of a handful of groups that inspire this level of dedication in their fans. Their music holds similar qualities to other classic \"favourite bands,\" like The Cure—their songs microcosms of ineffable longing and desolation. On their latest LP Rhinestones, HTRK continue to embrace stripped-down guitars, this time going for a twang and effects palette that evokes the Kodachrome skies of Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas. In the film, the sprawling vistas and stark photography set the stage for a hushed, heartbreaking drama. Here, the sparse guitar and unhurried progressions serve a similar purpose, foregrounding Standish's languid vocals.  As usual, deceptively simple lines like\"If you wanted to / Hang out with mе during the day,\" on \"Sunlight Feels Like Bee Stings,\" hit like a brick. —M.M.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify",

In his place sits a producer whose music is, with every new release, a truer, more vivid expression of not only his ever-broader tastes, but also his life and loves. Building on recent experiments with R&B and downtempo music, still slipping vol. 1 incorporates voice notes from his family—asking Joy how he's doing, making jokes, talking about weed brownies—into a cosy world of tunes that range from sedate garage to hooky, subdued pop. It feels like a Sunday afternoon in Joy's living room: vinyl all over the floor, loved ones popping in and out and talented friends occasionally jumping on the mic, all culminating into a more relaxed look at one of UK dance music's most quietly virtuosic producers.—Carlos Hawthorn\n\nListen:\n\nBandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music",

Mr. Mitch said this personal change occurred around the release of his 2017 album, Devout, a vulnerable record inspired by fatherhood. Not coincidentally, it was also the first time his fans had truly embraced his experimentations with slower tempos, ornate instrumentation and song-oriented structures. The Londoner built on this newfound freedom and confidence on this year's Lazy, with 11 tracks packing a range of energies and emotions. There are heart-rending tributes to his own musician father and strong statements about racism and social justice (the title is a reference to stereotypes about Black people), blending not only genres but personal and political messages in a way that could have felt forced and overblown in less accomplished hands. Instead, one feels profoundly moved. —C.H.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud",

If he was around now, Reflection might soothe those fears. James' mesmerising neo-IDM classic gestures towards dance music or bedroom R&B, only to take sudden detours into terra incognito that eludes categorisation altogether. (Nothing feels more appropriate than the outro being titled \"We're Building Something New.\") Sludgy, off-kilter kicks thud under pensive chords like some alien life form's interpretation of dance music. At times heartbreaking, at others startlingly vulnerable, James contemplates pandemic-era existentialism, projecting anxieties about the future with a ghostly delivery that feels like inner monologues being broadcast for all to hear: \"This is a reflection / Just mine, not yours.\" —E.O\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music  / Soundcloud",

Humming synths and drones conjure the flickering shadows of twilight, while her voice adds bursts of vivid colour.

True to their jazz roots, the group of rotating musicians—led by DJ and multi-instrumentalist Cesar Toribio—start the record as improvisational jams before narrowing down a vision and a concept. Their live approach is tangible: several tracks start on simple refrains before morphing into full-bodied flurries of dreamy funk, Afro-Latin percussion and downtempo beats. In homage to the clave (an instrument and rhythmic pattern), Toribio and his players concoct a joyous commemoration of the power of collaboration, unity and the cathartic energy of house music itself.—N.C.\n\nListen:\nBandcamp / Spotify / Apple Music  / Soundcloud",

Turns out, their styles complement each other. \"Straight Murder (Giggs & David),\" their second collaboration, showed both rappers at the top of their games, Dave relentless and razor-sharp, Giggs somehow both jovial and vicious.

Taking cues from happy hardcore, drum & bass and house, the record opens with blissful house tracks \"I'm Waiting (Just 4 U)\" and the title track, recalling the late-night euphoria of last year's DNT STP MY LV. The \"you\" here refers to Jordan, who has recently come out to the public as non-binary.\n\nThere's a feeling of triumph that emanates from \"For You.\" The track shows Jordan's knack for chopping and looping vocal samples, this one employing the amorous hook of Change's \"You Are My Melody.\" The loop never gets old, and as satisfying as the final climactic breakdown of the track is, when the familiar hook comes back around, it makes you wonder why it left in the first place. But the vocals aren't all that make the track pop. \"For You\" is swaddled in an addictive sunny feeling, thanks to funky guitar riffs, seesawing '80s synths and rousing percussion. The track captures the dizzying joy of finding true love—in this case, the love of one's self. \n\n\nListen: Bandcamp / Apple Music / Spotify  / Soundcloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif(window && !!window.LazyLoad){new window.LazyLoad({elements_selector:\".lazy\"});}",
